Ho, Abelon! What brings you to the dungeons, my friend? I don't suppose it's anything pleasant, at any rate.

a1: ~Abelon 1
...Nothing to concern yourself with, Kath. Routine business on the orders of His Majesty.

a1: ~Kath 2
Keeping the cold iron between us, yet again. Truly, Abelon, is something troubling you?

a1: ~CHOICE 0
a1: I'm fine
b1: I'm uneasy

a1: ~Kath 2
Hm...*sigh*. Yes, well, at least let me know if you're going to be terrorizing those poor young inmates, so I can excuse myself for some air.
I don't care to hear those screams again...

a1: ~Abelon 1
Your delicate ears have nothing to fear from me, or the prisoners. Good day, Kath.

a1: ~Kath 2
...Good day, Abelon.

a2: ~Kath 2
You've changed...

b1: ~Kath 1
Ah, the game is up! And what manner of menace dogs your dreams, my fellow knight? It's been a few days of the cold shoulder, and I'll have you know I've been worried!

b1: ~Abelon 1
You, a worrier? Don't make me laugh. But it's only King Sinclair that's been on my mind lately.

b1: ~Kath 3
The king's premier knight looking after his liege? Sounds... ordinary. Surely there's more to it than that.

b1: ~Abelon 1
You preempt me, as usual. His Majesty has not been himself lately. His demands have been... strange...

b2: ~Kath 1
You can't keep secrets from me, Abelon!



c1: ~Kath 1
Trying intimidation tactics with the old bastard, hm? Trust me, you'd have better luck trying to scare a rock. He just never backs down!

c1: ~CHOICE 0
c1: Indeed
d1: I'll show him

c1: ~Kath 2
Sheesh...you have to wonder what lit such a fire under him...

d1: ~Kath 2
Believe me, Abelon, that's what I told myself...

e1: ~Kath 2
Don't bother trying to figure out what his deal is. Honestly, pulling that kind of stunt in broad daylight..

f1: ~Kath 2
Crazy old codger... Don't let me catch you heading over there again so soon! He won this round, I'm telling you!
