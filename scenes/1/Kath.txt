Ho, Abelon! What brings you to the dungeons, my friend? I don't suppose it's anything pleasant, at any rate.

A: ~Abelon 1
...Nothing to concern yourself with, Kath. Routine business on the orders of His Majesty.

A: ~Kath 2
Keeping the cold iron between us, yet again. Truly, Abelon, is something troubling you?

A: ~CHOICE 0
A: I'm fine
B: I'm uneasy

A: ~Kath 2
Hm...*sigh*. Yes, well, at least let me know if you're going to be terrorizing those poor young inmates, so I can excuse myself for some air.
I don't care to hear those screams again...

A: ~Abelon 1
Your delicate ears have nothing to fear from me, or the prisoners. Good day, Kath.

A: ~Kath 2
...Good day, Abelon.



B: ~Kath 1
Ah, the game is up! And what manner of menace dogs your dreams, my fellow knight? It's been a few days of the cold shoulder, and I'll have you know I've been worried!

B: ~Abelon 1
You, a worrier? Don't make me laugh. But it's only King Sinclair that's been on my mind lately.

B: ~Kath 3
The king's premier knight looking after his liege? Sounds... ordinary. Surely there's more to it than that.

B: ~Abelon 1
You preempt me, as usual. His Majesty has not been himself lately. His demands have been... strange...
