A: ~Kath
Ho, Abelon! What brings you to the dungeons, my friend? I don't suppose it's anything pleasant, at any rate.
A: ~Abelon
...Nothing to concern yourself with, Kath. Routine business on the orders of His Majesty.
A: ~Kath
Keeping the cold iron between us, yet again. Truly, Abelon, is something troubling you?
A: ~CHOICE
A: I'm fine
B: I'm uneasy
A: ~Kath
Hm...*sigh*. Yes, well, at least let me know if you're going to be terrorizing those poor young inmates, so I can excuse myself for some air.
I don't care to hear those screams again...
A: ~Abelon
Your delicate ears have nothing to fear from me, or the prisoners. Good day, Kath.
A: ~Kath
...Good day, Abelon.


B: ~Kath
Ah, the game is up! And what manner of menace dogs your dreams, my fellow knight? It's been a few days of the cold shoulder,
and I'll have you know I've been worried!
B: ~Abelon
You, a worrier? Don't make me laugh. Anyways, it's only King Sinclair that's been on my mind lately.
B: ~Kath
The king's premier knight looking after his liege? Sounds...ordinary. Surely there's more to it than that.
B: ~Abelon
You preempt me, as usual. His Majesty has not been himself lately. His demands have been...strange...
