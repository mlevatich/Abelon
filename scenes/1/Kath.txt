Ho, Abelon! What brings you to the dungeons, my friend? I don't suppose it's anything pleasant, at any rate.
~Abelon
...Nothing to concern yourself with, Kath. Routine business on the orders of His Majesty.
~Kath
Keeping cold iron between us, yet again. Truly, Abelon, is something troubling you?
~Abelon
Nothing troubles me.
~Kath
Hm...*sigh*. Yes, well, at least let me know if you're going to be terrorizing those poor young inmates again, so I can excuse myself for some air.
I don't care to hear those screams again...
~Abelon
Your delicate ears have nothing to fear from me, or the prisoners. Good day, Kath.
~Kath
...Good day, Abelon.
