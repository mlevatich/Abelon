CHAPTER 4: Mistram
******************



*****
NOTES
*****

At some point, Abelon begs to have some control. You can agree, or tell him his
choices are wrong. The latter ultimately turns him against you, while the former
opens him up to be influenced by your good or bad deeds.

Final battle is an encounter with the Messenger where you defend against it.

Defending Mistram interrupts the rest area. Corrupted miners turn on you.
What to do? Can they be saved?

Need Uther and Opal to win the final battle of Chapter 2.

The choices in chapter 2 are all about reconciling Uther and the miners with
Opal and the guard.

Abelon likes you if you side with the guard, and doesn't like if you side with
the miners. If you unify them, he comes to understand a little more.

Learn here that Mona is Kath's mother, and that Kath is a woman.

At some point, you have the option of having Ebonach soldiers cross the Sonder
for some reason, led by Jericho. It is hinted that the expedition will be
extremely dangerous and is a bad idea. Whoever you choose to send (if you
have a choice) will die to the Messenger.

Other citizens in Mistram:
The miners
The guard
The children and caretakers at the day care (children are raised communally â€“
all other hands on deck to mine and, sometimes, be on the guard)
