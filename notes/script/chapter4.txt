CHAPTER 4: Mistram
******************



*****
NOTES
*****

Final battle is an encounter with the Messenger where you defend against it.

Defending Mistram interrupts the rest area. Corrupted miners turn on you. What to do? Can they be saved?

Need Uther and Opal and Mona to win the final battle of Chapter 2.

The choices in chapter 2 are all about reconciling Uther and the miners with Opal and the guard.

Abelon likes you if you side with the guard, and doesn't like if you side with the miners.
If you unify them, he comes to understand a little more.
