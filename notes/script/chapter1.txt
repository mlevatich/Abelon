CHAPTER 1: The Forest Stirs
***************************



*****
NOTES
*****

In the forest to the north of Ebonach.

A monster attack has come from the north and west – wolves. Abelon, Kath, and some of the knights were dispatched to
the north, where the enemy was strongest, but they have struggled to repel the monsters.

Amidst the fighting, Abelon disappears. Kath notices, and leaves the fighting to look for him. Abelon,
feeling the situation to be dire, left to find a spot to cast an incantation from his book. In a clearing
to the west, having shaken the wolves off his trail, Abelon begins the ritual, hoping to return to the fight
with renewed power and turn the tide.

injured hunter, either look for wornfleet leaves, or go to lester the healer to get them.

Further option to confuse kath by commenting on how much he knows about medicine.

costume change when the hunter is healed

present leaves to hunter

many dialogue choices when talking to kath/lester.

find a medallion in the grass somewhere, not used till chapter 1

interact with environment to pick up leaves.

three battles – first wolf, then a few wolves, then the big fight. Second fight causes a level up.

In the big fight, must kill all wolves, prevent them from entering city. More knights saved = bigger reward.

If you personally save Elaine, and haven't done fight 2 yet, she will join you, making it a much easier fight. Whichever
battle is her first, she will comment on it.

Shanti - Field Alchemist. Has an extra-turn ability, and various effects. Send her to save Elaine. Wields an ignea lantern.
Lester - Shadowblade. Uses electrical magic and an enchanted dagger to assassinate foes.
Elaine - Hunter. Uses a bow and the terrain to her advantage, out-positioning enemies.

In the final fight, all three might be there if you save Elaine quickly. You can send Shanti after her to rescue her.
If you take too long saving Elaine, Lester will be dead, and if you don't rescue Elaine during the battle, she will
be dead. Whoever is in the battle cannot die without triggering a fail state, so at least two will survive.

If you go straight to the knights without finding Elaine: (3 generic, 4 controlled, easy fight) - ELAINE DIES
If you find Elaine but leave her: (2 generic, 4 controlled, medium fight) - ELAINE DIES
If you send Shanti after Elaine to save her: (2 generic, 4 controlled, hard fight) - SAVED ALL 3
If you save her in one leaf: (1 generic, 5 controlled, hard fight) - SAVED ALL 3
If you save her in two leaves: (1 generic, 4 controlled, extremely hard fight) - LESTER DIES
If you ever fight the wolves by the deer: (0 generic, 3/4 controlled, impossible fight) - LESTER DIES

In the big fight, the boss wolf has ignea crystals embedded in him. Cause for concern.

If you save Elaine before the final battle she will fight with you, making some special comments during her first fight.

Quest States: hunter status, fighting knights status, abelon spell

Info-drops:
Further north is a ruined city
We're in a kingdom
Monster attacks are especially frequent
There's another attack from the West
Kingdom is strapped due to attacks

SCENE: PROLOGUE

// black screen

???: "...and no........y this ri......power unto......ummon thee................all of us!"

// Slow fade in to Abelon standing in the middle of a summoning circle drawn in blood, in a clearing in a forest.
// An open book lies on the ground nearby. The player gains control without any fanfare.

- Interact - Book - "An open book lies on the ground, full of strange drawings and hastily scrawled paragraphs.
                     The writing is faded and barely legible, and the pages practically crumble to dust at the
                     slightest touch."

// Moving to the east through the clearing entrance, out of sight of the summoning circle,
// triggers the following cinematic

???: "Abelon! At last!"

// Kath enters from the east and begins speaking to Abelon

???: "By Ignus, what are you doing out here? The knights are pinned at the north gate, to the man,
      and suddenly you disappear! Come, we must return to the fight. Without our steel, the beasts might
      finally break through to the gilded district...ach, we'd all be in for it then."

???: "Wait, your arm. You're wounded. Let me see that."

// A red glow briefly surrounds Abelon. His wound is healed.

???: "I'll have none of your usual protests about bandages and such, that sword arm of yours is well worth my ignea.
      Did one of the wolves follow you here? Did you kill it?"

A: No, I'm alone

    ???: "You're...well, what got your arm then? Hold on, what's all that behind you?"

    A: A ritual

        ???: "That sign in the earth is your work, then? Which explains your arm, but...a blood rite, Abelon? I've
              only ever heard of them in stories...The kinds of stories that don't end well."

        ???: "Whatever you've done, I dearly hope it will help us live to see daylight. We've wasted too much time
              talking already. If you're not in danger here, we need to reinforce our soldiers, immediately. Come on!"

    A: I don't know (Kath +1 awareness)

        ???: "Hm, well I don't remember seeing it when I was last on salvage to the Ash...but it's a curiosity for
              another time. If you're not in danger here, we need to reinforce our soldiers, immediately. Come on!"

A: Who are you? (Kath +2 awareness)

    ???: "...What?"

    ???: "Whatever's happened to you here, it's of less importance than the battle at the gate. Come, we must
          reinforce our soldiers immediately!"

// Kath takes a few steps east, and suddenly stops

???: "Ah. They must have followed me here. I'm sorry, Abelon."

// The screen pans to the right, revealing two creatures that look like rabid wolves, facing towards the two knights.
// A trail of blood on the ground starts at one of them and goes offscreen.

A: You shouldn't have come, then (Kath -2 impression)

    ???: "Well, a word of warning before running off might have accomplished as much! I suppose if I had vanished
          in the middle of a battle, you wouldn't have spared me a second thought, then. Cold and calculating
          to the last, our veteran captain is...Let's finish these beasts off quickly, so we can reach the knights."

A: Nothing we can't handle (Kath +1 impression)

    ???: "Now there's the grizzled old knight I remember! You had me worried for a moment. Let's finish them off
          quickly so we can reach the knights!"

-- Begin battle

*Turn 1 start*

    ???: "Right, let's do the usual song and dance, then. The young upstart will take his orders from the grumpy
          old man."

    Kath: "Captain Kath of Lefellen, at your command!"

*Enemy turn 1 start*

    Kath: "Here they come!"

*Turn 2 start*

    Kath: "Let's only use as much ignea as we need to. I shouldn't have to remind you, we've nowhere to reignite here
           in the forest, and we'll need as much power as we can spare when we return to the gates."

*When Abelon uses a demonic spell for the first time*

    Kath: "By Ignus, what the hell did you just do, Abelon? I've never seen such unbelievable magic!"

    A: A reward from the blood rite (Kath +1 impression)

        Kath: "Amazing...perhaps your little detour was worth the trouble after all."

    A: A secret spell of mine (Kath -1 impression)

        Kath: "Oh really? I seem to recall a great many dire situations which this 'secret spell' of yours would have
               resolved in short order. But you've never been one for sharing, have you..."

    *If not in final fight*

        Kath: "Do save your ignea for our reunion with the knights, though. I suspect we'll need that spell again
               when the real fight begins, and even I can tell that unholy fire was no cheap cantrip."

*Kath dies*

    Kath: "Urgh. Damn, hurts........But I refuse...to........"

    FAIL STATE

*Abelon dies*

    Kath: "Abelon, no! NO!"

    FAIL STATE

*First wolf killed*

    Kath: "That wolf won't be standing up again, at the very least. Forward! Aflame and alert, as they say."

*Victory*

    Kath: *huff* *huff* Ach, they aren't so tough when it's just a couple of the bastards.

    A: Nice bladework (Kath +1 impression, +1 awareness)

        Kath: "Why, a compliment? From you? I must have really outdone myself this time, or else you took a blow to
               the head."

    A: They didn't stand a chance

        Kath: "No indeed, they didn't. I don't envy anyone or anything at the wrong end of your sword."

-- End battle

*If Abelon is wounded*

    Kath: "Let me see your wounds."

    // Kath approaches Abelon. A red glow surrounds Abelon and Kath as they are healed.

*If Abelon is healthy*

    Kath: "And not a scratch on you! Your skills never fail to impress, truly."

Kath: "Now then, thankfully you didn't wander off too far from the fighting. The north gate is just ahead to the east,
       first right turn on this path. We'll have to keep an eye out for more wolves – I'll follow behind you and watch
       our back."

// Kath walks forward, and stops at the bleeding wolf's original location

Kath: "But look here. This trail of blood came dribbling from that wolf's mouth...he must have gotten to something
       before he found us. It could be someone wounded in need of help, but following it will lead us away from Ebonach
       and lose us time...damn!"

// The player gains control of Abelon, and Kath follows behind. The player may choose to go north following the blood,
// or continue east towards the north gate.



SCENE: WITHIN EARSHOT

// If the player continues east after the first fight, or after dealing with the hunter, or even on approach from
// the east side after fighting the battle with the deer, the following scene plays.

// A cutscene begins and the screen pans slightly downward.

???: "Stand tall! Don't let a single one– Aagh!"

???: "If you've got ignea left, launch a bolt on my signal! Ready...aim..."

???: "Where are the captains?"

???: "Hyaaaaaah!"

// The screen pans up again.

Kath: "From the sound of it, we haven't been overrun yet. Good.

// The screen pans towards the enemies

Kath: "But ach, ghouls on top of wolves? This just gets worse and worse. Let's cut our way through!"

A: Who's commanding the knights? (Kath -1 impression)

    Kath: "Eruta only knows, after you abandoned them and I had to come chasing after you..."

    *If told Kath about ritual*

        Kath: "Let's hope that ritual of yours was worth it. Ready your sword."

    *If not told Kath about the ritual*

        Kath: "King Sinclair will expect an explanation from you, you know, if we make it out of this alive.
               Ready your sword."

A: I shouldn't have left (Kath +1 impression, +1 awareness)

    *if Kath awareness >= 3*

        Kath: "Abelon, you...something's different about you, I swear it. But now's not the time for that, is it...
               ready your sword."

    *if Kath awareness < 3*

        Kath: "But then, why did you...but I suppose now's not the time for that, is it? Ready your sword."

-- Begin battle

*Turn 1 start*

    Kath: "By Ignus, one of those ghouls somehow got hold of a rock of ignea! By the size, that'd be...good for a
           cantrip or two, unignited. Keep light on your feet, if that thing lands a spell on you it'll pierce right
           through your armor."

*Turn 2 start*

    Kath: "The risen dead...ach, no matter how many times I see it, it still makes my blood run cold. There must have
           been a graveyard here, at some point in the past. The Despair leaves nothing sacred..."

    A: It wasn't always this way

        Kath: "And with any luck, one day I'll get a taste of the peace and tranquility you old geezers are always
               rattling on about. Ach, but I suspect there'll be plenty of ghouls standing between me and that day.
               Forward!"

    A: We'll get through it (Kath +1 impression, +1 awareness)

        Kath: "Hah! You, cheering me up? Now I've seen it all."

        Kath: "But if executioner Abelon is in good spirits and the charming Kath is caught sulking, people will think
               Eruta's turned upside down! More than it already has, anyway. Forward!"

*Victory*

    Kath: "Ach, what a nightmare, fighting those things. The wolves, I can stomach, but ghouls are another matter.
           Let's hope there are no more of them at the gates."

-- End battle



SCENE: THE CRYSTAL WOLF

TODO



SCENE: THE HUNTER

TODO



SCENE: THE HUNTED

// In the northeast of the forest, three wolves have cornered an injured deer. The scene can be approached from
// the west or the south. In either case, the following scene will trigger.

*All scenarios*

- Interact - Medallion - "A bronze medallion on a string, smeared with dirt. The image of a round shield over a
                          longsword is engraved in the metal."

    Text: "Pick it up?"

        A: Yes

            Text: "You brush the dirt off the medallion and put it in your pack"

            (gain 1 bronze medallion)

        A: No

            Text: "You leave the medallion on the ground"

// The screen pans towards the wolves

*If the crystal wolf is not yet defeated*

    Kath: "Hm, that deer looks to be about done for. Let's turn around while the wolves are distracted. We've no
           business here, the knights need our help."

    // Abelon gains control again. If you approach closer, a battle will trigger.

    -- Begin battle

    *Turn 1 start*

        (Kath impression -1)

        Kath: "Abelon, this is a mistake...but they've already noticed us. We'll have to fight!"

    *Victory*

        Kath: "Ach, this is bad...we've been gone far too long. Leave the deer. Come on, to the north gate!"

    -- End battle

    - Interact - Deer - "A young deer, with a gash across the stomach. Its chest rises and falls erratically.
                         It's clearly having trouble breathing."

        (Kath impression -1)

        Kath: "Abelon, what are you doing? I said leave the deer!"

*If the crystal wolf is defeated, but the area was already visited*

    -- Begin battle

    *Turn 1 start*

        Kath: "Now that we know the capital is secure, we can take care of the rest of the wolves. We need to make sure
               the forest is safe for hunters, else we'll lose a vital food source."

    *Victory*

        Kath: "*huff* That should be the last of them. Let's return to Ebonach. The king will be glad to know we've
               been successful."

        Kath: "Ach, shame about that deer, though. Poor thing never stood a chance."

*If the crystal wolf is defeated, and the area was not already visited*

    Kath: "" TODO

*If the crystal wolf is defeated, and the wolves were already killed*

    This state cannot be reached – if the wolves here are fought before the crystal wolf the battle with the crystal
    wolf is unwinnable – most of the knights are dead.
