In the forest to the north of Ebonach. Map is drawn in notebook.

A monster attack has come from the north and west – wolves. Abelon, Kath, and some of the knights were dispatched to
the north, where the enemy was strongest, but they have struggled to repel the monsters.

Amidst the fighting, Abelon disappears. Kath notices, and leaves the fighting to look for him. Abelon,
feeling the situation to be dire, left to find a spot to cast an incantation from his book. In a clearing
to the west, having shaken the wolves off his trail, Abelon begins the ritual, hoping to return to the fight
with renewed power and turn the tide.

injured hunter, either look for wornfleet leaves, or go to lester the healer to get them.

Further option to confuse kath by commenting on how much he knows about medicine.

costume change when the knight is healed

present leaves to knight

many dialogue choices when talking to kath/lester.

find a medallion in the grass somewhere, not used till chapter 1

interact with environment to pick up leaves.

three battles – first wolf, then a few wolves, then the big fight. Second fight causes a level up.

In the big fight, condition to talk to lester if you found the knight but haven't healed him. Must kill all wolves,
prevent them from entering city. More knights saved = bigger reward. If lester dies or you wait until after the fight
to talk to him, it's too late to save the knight. Lester must leave during the fight.

In the big fight, the boss wolf has ignea crystals embedded in him. Cause for concern.

Fail state if you pick up the wrong leaf, then insist on finding the right one. When you get to the last battle,
all the knights will be dead and it will be unwinnable.

Couple optional fights in the north. Result in the area being cleared for hunters. You can do these after the big fight,
if you want. If you choose to engage them before the big fight, it will also lead to the fail state of being too late.
You can only do these if you have the resources left after the big fight – enough ignea and health.

Saving the injured knight earns the biggest reward of the chapter. Maybe he tells you to come visit him in the barracks
afterwards? Something new in chapter 1.

Quest States: Injured knight status, fighting knight status, abelon spell

Impressions tracked: How much does Kath suspect?

Info-drops:
Further north is a ruined city
We're in a kingdom
Monster attacks are especially frequent
There's another attack from the West
Kingdom is strapped due to attacks
We're both knight captains, and we command these knights.
Hunters find game here, important to keep path clear.

SCRIPT

SCENE: PROLOGUE

// black screen

???: "...and no........y this ri......power unto......ummon thee................all of us!"

// Slow fade in to Abelon standing in the middle of a summoning circle drawn in blood, in a clearing in a forest.
// An open book lies on the ground nearby. The player gains control without any fanfare.

- Interact - Book - "An open book lies on the ground, full of strange drawings and hastily scrawled paragraphs.
                     The writing is faded and barely legible, and the pages practically crumble to dust at the
                     slightest touch."

// Moving to the east through the clearing entrance, out of sight of the summoning circle,
// triggers the following cinematic

???: "Abelon! Finally!"

// Kath enters from the east and begins speaking to Abelon

???: "By Ignus, what are you doing out here? The knights are pinned at the north gate, to the man,
      and suddenly you disappear! Come, we must return to the fight. Without our steel, the beasts might
      finally break through to the gilded district...ach, we'd all be in for it then."

???: "Wait, your arm. You're wounded. Let me see that."

// A red glow briefly surrounds Abelon. His wound is healed.

???: "I'll have none of your usual protests about bandages and such, that sword arm of yours is well worth my ignea.
      Did one of the wolves follow you here? Did you kill it?"

A: No, I'm alone

    ???: "You're...well, what got your arm then? Hold on, what's all that behind you?"

    A: A ritual (Kath -1 impression)

        ???: "That sign in the earth is your work, then? Which explains your arm, but...a blood rite, Abelon? I've
              only ever heard of them in stories...The kinds of stories that don't end well."

        ???: "Whatever you've done, I dearly hope it will help us live to see daylight. We've wasted too much time
              talking already. If you're not in danger here, we need to reinforce our soldiers, immediately. Come on!"

    A: I don't know (Kath +1 awareness)

        ???: "Hm, well I don't remember seeing it when I was last on salvage to the Ash...but it's a curiosity for
              another time. If you're not in danger here, we need to reinforce our soldiers, immediately. Come on!"

A: Who are you? (Kath +2 awareness)

    ???: "...What? " TODO

// Kath takes a few steps east, and suddenly stops

???: "Ah. They must have followed me here. I'm sorry, Abelon."

// The screen pans to the right, revealing two creatures that look like rabid wolves, facing towards the two knights.
// A trail of blood on the ground starts at one of them and goes offscreen.

A: You shouldn't have come, then (Kath -2 impression)

    ???: "Well, a word of warning before running off might have accomplished as much! I suppose if I had vanished
          in the middle of a battle, you wouldn't have spared me a second thought, then. Cold and calculating
          to the last, our veteran captain is...Let's finish these beasts off quickly, so we can reach the knights."

A: Nothing we can't handle (Kath +1 impression)

    ???: "Now there's the grizzled old knight I remember! You had me worried for a moment. Let's finish them off
          quickly so we can reach the knights!"

-- Begin battle

*Turn 1 start*

    ???: "Right, let's do the usual song and dance, then. The young upstart will take his orders from the grumpy
          old man."

    Kath: "Captain Kath of Lefellen, at your command!"

*Enemy turn 1 start*

    Kath: "Here they come!"

*Turn 2 start*

    Kath: "Let's only use as much ignea as we need to. I shouldn't have to remind you, we've nowhere to reignite here
           in the forest, and we'll need as much power as we can spare when we return to the gates."

*When Abelon uses a demonic spell for the first time*

    Kath: "By Ignus, what the hell did you just do, Abelon? I've never seen such unbelievable magic!"

    A: A reward from the blood rite (Kath +1 impression)

        Kath: "Amazing...perhaps your little detour was worth the trouble after all."

    A: A secret spell of mine (Kath -1 impression)

        Kath: "Oh really? I seem to recall a great many dire situations which this 'secret spell' of yours would have
               resolved in short order. But you've never been one for sharing, have you..."

    *If not in final fight*

        Kath: "Do save your ignea for our reunion with the knights, though. I suspect we'll need that spell again
               when the real fight begins, and even I can tell that unholy fire was no cheap cantrip."

*Kath dies*

    Kath: "Urgh. Damn, hurts........But I refuse...to........"

    FAIL STATE

*Abelon dies*

    Kath: "Abelon, no! NO!"

    FAIL STATE

*First wolf killed*

    Kath: "That wolf won't be standing up again, at the very least. Forward! Aflame and alert, as they say."

*Victory*

    Kath: *huff* *huff* Ach, they aren't so tough when it's just a couple of the bastards.

    A: Nice bladework (Kath +1 impression, +1 awareness)

        Kath: "Why, a compliment? From you? I must have really outdone myself this time, or else you took a blow to
               the head."

    A: They didn't stand a chance

        Kath: "No indeed, they didn't. I don't envy anyone or anything at the wrong end of your sword."

-- End battle

*If Abelon is wounded*

    Kath: "Let me see your wounds."

    // Kath approaches Abelon. A red glow surrounds Abelon and Kath as they are healed.

*If Abelon is healthy*

    Kath: "And not a scratch on you! Your skills never fail to impress, truly."

Kath: "Now then, thankfully you didn't wander off too far from the fighting. The north gate is just ahead to the east,
       first right turn on this path. We'll have to keep an eye out for more wolves – I'll follow behind you and watch
       our back."

// Kath walks forward, and stops at the bleeding wolf's original location

Kath: "But look here. This trail of blood came dribbling from that wolf's mouth...he must have gotten to something
       before he found us. It could be someone wounded in need of help, but following it will lead us away from Ebonach
       and lose us time...damn!"

// The player gains control of Abelon, and Kath follows behind. The player may choose to go north following the blood,
// or continue east towards the north gate.
