CHAPTER 1: The Forest Stirs
***************************

*******
SUMMARY
*******

A monster attack has come from the north and west of Ebonach in the early
hours of the morning – wolves. The drawbridges over the moats were somehow let
down and sabotaged overnight, allowing the wolves passage into the city. Abelon,
Kath, and a small group of their most skilled fighters were dispatched to the
north to hold the enemy off at the bridge, which acts as a chokepoint. Jericho
and the main army was sent to the wide bridge at the city's western entrance,
where the enemy was strongest.

Captains Abelon and Kath, along with Abelon's knights Shanti and Ceryl, and
Kath's knight Lester, fight at the bridge and drive back the wolves. They move
towards the forest as the city guard repairs the broken drawbridge behind them.
At this point, Abelon commands that the others retreat across the bridge, but
that he has a matter to attend to in the forest. Kath protests that Abelon will
not survive the forest alone and that they should all retreat together, but
Abelon insists, and strikes out into the trees as the other knights go back
across the bridge. It's not long, however, before a fearful Kath and Ceryl
decide to disobey the senior captain and go after him, and Lester and Shanti
follow behind.

Abelon, unbeknownst to the others, was in possession of a ritual text given to
him by the late Cardinal at the moment of her execution. The Cardinal told him
that the ritual would give him the power he needed to protect Ebonach, the power
of a demon. The ritual's instructions specified an old clearing in the forest,
and Abelon felt that, with the nearby wolves defeated, this was his best and
only chance to perform the ritual safely without exposing his comrades to
danger. He quickly makes his way to the clearing and begins a ritual lost to
folklore known as a blood rite.

Kath, Ceryl, Lester, and Shanti tread cautiously into the forest, several
minutes behind Abelon. They soon encounter a wolf, which Lester volunteers to
fend off. Kath moves west, while Shanti and Ceryl move east in search of Abelon.

As Abelon completes the ritual, he loses control of his own body, and the player
takes control. Moving east slightly, you meet up with a panicked Kath. You feel
a rumbling earthquake before being approached by wolves.

After fending off the wolves, Kath notices a blood trail from one of their
mouths, leading north. Could it be Lester? There's a choice between
investigating it and continuing east to the knights. Reaching turn limits
causes a game over in which Kath comments that they're too late.

If you move north, you find Elaine, a hunter who was injured and is unable to
move. A wolf is approaching her. You and Kath rush to save her, and after
dealing with the wolf, Kath realizes she is poisoned by a wolf bite. Kath heals
her, but she is paralyzed by the poison and can't move. Kath suggests a salve
made from Wornfleet leaves, which he sends you to get while he guards Elaine,
or alternatively points out that Lester has some and if they reach him he could
cure her. Wornfleet is found to the north-west - Kath will stop you if you
try to move north east. If you personally save Elaine with Wornfleet, she will
fight with you. Whichever battle is her first, she will comment on it. If you
save Elaine, Shanti and Lester start off the next two fights with much lower
health, because you took longer to get to them. If you never meet Elaine, she
will die. If you meet her and then proceed to Lester, you will instruct him to
go to her after the battle. He and Elaine will join the next fight in the
middle.

Heading east from the clearing, you meet up with Lester, who is heading off some
wolves and some kind of sentient stone monster with rocks of ignea sticking out
of it. Lester is panicked, he says the monster forced him further north away
from Shanti and Ceryl, and it appeared when the earthquake happened. Also it's
using magic to create ignaeic explosions, even though no monster has ever been
known to use magic. You fight off the enemies. If you want to save Elaine, you
need to get Lester to escape left before the battle ends, as Kath explains.

After this point, Elaine is dead, and stumbling on her will confirm as much.

After defeating the enemies, you need to move east and find Shanti and Ceryl,
who are fighting wolves of their own. If you approach from the north-west, the
party comments that you took the long way around and Shanti and Ceryl have lower
health, but you start in a more advantageous position. If you approach from the
south-west, the fight begins as normal. If Lester was sent to get Elaine, the
two will arrive healthy as reinforcements from the north-west during the fight.
Otherwise Lester joins at the start (and Elaine if she is with you).

After the fight, the party is all together again. There is brief conversation
before everyone agrees to head south to the gate before more strange monsters
arrive. Kath urges Abelon that whatever his business in the forest, he needs to
finish it without straying too far.

Upon reaching the drawbridge, another earthquake occurs, and two stone monsters
emerge by Ceryl. Lester screams at her to get back, but the monsters explode,
sending her flying into a tree and killing her instantly. More wolves approach
from behind the monsters, and the fight begins. The party must survive a number
of turns until the drawbridge is brought down, so they can escape across.

When the party escapes across the bridge, the battle ends, and a tense argument
occurs over the blame for Ceryl's death and their inability to recover her body.
The chapter ends as the party enters Ebonach and a mysterious voice lashes out
in anger, demanding to be released.

           in a menu. Press D to cancel a selection."

Tutorial: "Selecting an enemy allows you to view information about the enemy."

Tutorial: "Selecting an ally allows you to move them, choose an attack, aim the
           attack, use the remainder of their movement, and then confirm the
           entire action."

           pressing D. Once you confirm, the chosen ally will perform their
           action all at once."

Tutorial: "Move yourself towards the enemy and aim an attack at it to damage it.
           Read the descriptions of your attacks and spells and pick the best
           option for the circumstances."

// Enemy phase 1 ends. The wolf needs two hits to kill Abelon, so you can't die
// yet, or have killed the wolf yet.

(Battle: Phases tutorial)
Tutorial: "Each ally may act only once during the ally phase. Once all allies
           have acted, the ally phase will end and all enemies on the
           battlefield will move and attack you. Then the ally phase begins
           again."

Tutorial: "An ally or enemy dies when their health, visible underneath them,
           reaches zero. Keep your allies alive and defeat all enemies to win
           the battle."

Tutorial: "Press E to open your inventory, where you can see and use the items
           you carry in your pack, inspect your traveling companions, change
           your settings, and read any of these tutorials."

- Book - "An open book lies on the ground, full of strange drawings and hastily
          scrawled paragraphs. The writing is faded and barely legible, and the
          pages practically crumble to dust at the slightest touch."

// Moving to the east through the clearing entrance, out of sight of the
// summoning circle, triggers the following cinematic

???: "Abelon! There you are! And you're still alive, thank Eruta."

// Kath enters from the east and begins speaking to Abelon

???: "Before you lay into me, yes, I heard your instructions perfectly clearly.
      The rest of us would cross the drawbridge and you would go back into the
      woods because you had some "matter to attend to"."

???: "But I'll remind you that you don't actually outrank me and I'm well
      within my rights to save you from your own terrible mistakes. By Ignus,
      what's gotten into you? How many times during training did you tell me it
      was a death sentence to enter the north forest alone?"

A: You were to not interfere

    ???: "Brush me off when your life isn't on the line, Abelon. I don't much
          care what your reasons are, the monsters are too dangerous for any one
          person, your considerable skill aside."

A: Who are you? (Kath +2 awareness)

    ???: "...What? Listen, brush me off when your life isn't on the line,
          Abelon. The monsters are too dangerous for any one person, your
          considerable skill aside."

// Kath pauses

???: "And look, you're wounded! Damn your pride, you've already proven me right.
      Let me see that."

// A red glow briefly surrounds Abelon. His wound is healed.

???: "I'll have none of your usual protests about bandages and such, that sword
      arm of yours is well worth my ignea... Speaking of which, I have a few
      rocks for you, if you've room to carry them."

A: I don't need them

    ???: "Then your pack is still full. That's good news."

A: Thanks, I'll take them

    ???: "Right, here you go. Ach, dropped one. Damn things are so small these
          days..."

    // Abelon's ignea is restored

A: Rocks? (Kath +1 awareness)

    ???: "Yes, rocks, and I'm starting to think one hit you on the head - rocks
          of Ignea, Abelon, what else would I be talking about? Here, take
          them."

    // Abelon's ignea is restored

???: "The bridge guards had some on hand, so the four of us shared them. We ran
      into a lone wolf at the crossroads north of the bridge. Lester engaged it
      and the rest of us split up to keep looking for you. I ran west from
      there, and here we are."

A: I'm grateful for the assistance (Kath +1 awareness, Kath +1 impression)

    ???: "Amazing. You're grateful, after you explicitly told us not to follow
          you. Do remind me to tell Lester I caught Executioner Abelon playing
          hard-to-get like some young lover at the Academy. He'll be in
          stitches."

    ???: "Anyway, have you finished out here? The sooner we reunite with the
          other three, the less danger we'll all be in."

A: I didn't ask for your assistance (Kath -1 impression)

    ???: "Unbelievable... you really think you're invincible, don't you? We're
          all out in the forest now, whether you like it or not, so are you
          finished here? The sooner we reunite with the other three, the less
          danger we'll all be in."

// Dialogue continues

A: I need more time (Kath -1 impression)

    ???: "We've minutes at most, Abelon, before monsters are drawn here by our
          presence. I can't force you to leave now, but whatever you're doing
          here, it had better be worth it. Find me when you're ready."

    // Dialogue ends. Kath moves to block the way east, so that you must talk
    // to him to proceed, but you can continue to explore the clearing.

A: We must find them immediately

    ???: "Then we're finally in agreement, thank Eruta."

// Talk to Kath again after ending the conversation, or continue from the
// answer above

???: "Let's hurry. Whatever spell or ritual it was that you performed here, you
      can save your explanation for His Majesty."

// A violent earthquake suddenly shakes the ground for a few seconds.

???: "By Ignus! That must have been the worst one since... I don't even
      remember!"

A: What just happened? (Kath +1 awareness)

    ???: "What, don't tell me, even now, you aren't accustomed to the tremors?
          You've spent more time in Mistram than I have, and from what I hear
          it's every other day by the mountains!"

A: Strongest one in my lifetime

    ???: "Really? Ach, all of this is giving me a terrible feeling in the pit
          of my stomach..."

A: I've felt worse

    ???: "Truly? But they weren't so common back when you were my age, surely."

???: "Any more powerful than that and the taller buildings in the city will be
      in danger, don't you think? Although... I can't speak for you, but I
      wouldn't miss that ugly statue of old Sinclair, if it did come tumbling
      down. Or maybe the Academy building will collapse, ha!"

// Kath pauses

???: "It seems like there won't be any aftershocks. Let's go."

// Kath takes a few steps east, and suddenly stops

???: "*sigh*... I suppose we both knew this wasn't going to be easy."

// The camera pans to reveal three wolves as Abelon walks to Kath's side

???: "One of them has blood dribbling from his mouth, you see there? He's
      gotten to something before us. Hold on, who else but us... that couldn't
      have been the one we left Lester to fight, could it? Don't tell me he..."

A: You think he's dead?

    ???: "Not dead, he couldn't be. Any of those three is more than capable of
          dealing with a mangy, rabid mutt. But that's exactly what makes me
          worry. Something must have happened..."

A: He's fine. Have a little faith (Kath +1 impression)

    ???: "Hah! You, cheering me up? Now I've seen it all."

    ???: "But you're right, of course. After all, what kind of captain would
          I be if one of my finest couldn't stand up to some pathetic,
          frothing dog? There must be another explanation."

???: "Though there won't be time to dwell on it. Draw your sword already,
      Abelon, they look like they're about to charge!"

-- Begin battle

// Ally phase 1

???: "Right, let's do the usual song and dance, then. The young upstart will
      take his orders from the grumpy old man."

(Battle: Assists tutorial)
Tutorial: "After using an attack or spell and finishing their movement, an ally
           may additionally use an 'Assist' skill, which is aimed at some set of
           grid tiles."

Tutorial: "For the remainder of the turn (ally and enemy phase), any ally
           standing on an assisted grid tile benefits from the effects of
           the assist skill."

Tutorial: "Position allies to attack from tiles with offensive assists, and
           end their actions on tiles with defensive assists. With three or more
           allies, one unit can even benefit from multiple assists at the same
           time."

// Select Kath

Kath: "Captain Kath of Ebonach, at your command!"

// Enemy phase 1

Kath: "Here they come!"

// Ally phase 2

Kath: "Let's only use as much ignea as we need to. I shouldn't have to remind
       you we've a limited supply with us here in the forest, and there's no
       telling how many monsters stand between us and the drawbridge."

(Battle: Ignea tutorial)
Tutorial: "Many powerful skills consume some amount of Ignea, shown in the
           'Cost' section of their description. Ignea is a precious stone, and
           each unit in battle has a limited supply, shown in their Attributes."

Tutorial: "Be careful with these skills – it may be a long time and multiple
           battles before you can acquire more Ignea."

// Ally phase 3

(Battle: Attributes tutorial)
Tutorial: "The capabilities of a unit are summarized by their 'Attributes'."

Tutorial: "Endurance determines a unit's maximum health, and Focus determines
           their maximum Ignea usage - how efficiently they can use the supply
           of stones they have."

Tutorial: "Force determines the effectiveness of many attacks and spells, and
           Affinity determines the effectiveness of many assists."

Tutorial: "Every two points of Reaction mitigates one point of Weapon Damage.
           Spell Damage, however, always bypasses Reaction."

Tutorial: "Every five points of Agility confers one grid tile of movement in
           battle."

// First wolf killed

Kath: "That wolf won't be standing up again, at the very least. Forward!
       Aflame and alert, as they say."

// When Abelon uses Conflagration or Crucible for the first time

Kath: "By Ignus, what the hell did you just do, Abelon? I've never seen
       such unbelievable magic!"

A: You think I came out here for nothing? (Kath +1 impression)

    Kath: "Ha... ha ha ha! I still can't fathom why you didn't share your
           plans with the rest of us, but I suppose the one thing I
           should've known better than to do was doubt Captain Abelon!"

A: A secret spell of mine (Kath -1 impression)

    Kath: "Oh really? I seem to recall a great many dire situations which
           this 'secret spell' of yours would have resolved in short order.
           But you've never been one for sharing, have you..."

*If not in final fight*

    Kath: "Do save your ignea for our reunion with the knights, though. We
           might need that spell again on our way to the drawbridge, and
           even I can tell that unholy fire was no cheap cantrip."

// Kath dies

Kath: "Urgh. Damn, hurts........ But I refuse... to........"

DEFEAT

// Abelon dies

Kath: "Abelon, no! NO!"

DEFEAT

// Victory

Kath: "*huff* *huff* Ach, they aren't so tough when it's just a couple of the
       bastards."

A: Nice bladework (Kath +1 impression, +1 awareness)

    Kath: "Why, a compliment? From you? I must have really outdone myself this
           time, or else you took a blow to the head."

A: They didn't stand a chance

    Kath: "No indeed, they didn't. I don't envy anyone or anything at the wrong
           end of your sword."

-- End battle

*If Abelon is wounded*

    Kath: "Let me see your wounds."

    // Kath approaches Abelon. A red glow surrounds Abelon and Kath as they are
    // healed.

*If Abelon is healthy*

    Kath: "And not a scratch on you! Your skills never fail to impress, truly."

Kath: "Let's see... This blood is fresh, and the trail's visible, at least.
       Tracking it will be slow going, but it should take us straight to
       whatever the beast took a bite out of."

Kath: "More than likely it's some poor animal, a deer maybe. The wolf Lester
       distracted was further east of here. And the blood couldn't be Ceryl or
       Shanti's, they had gone the other way at the crossroads."

Kath: "But could Lester have finished off that wolf and then followed after me?
       By Ignus, if it is a person's blood, we'd be leaving them for dead... but
       if it comes to nothing, we'd waste too much time! More monsters could
       surround us even further from the bridge. Damn... damn! You make the
       call, Abelon."

// The player gains control of Abelon. The player may choose to go north
// following the blood, or continue east towards the crossroads.

(Experience and Learning tutorial)
Tutorial: "In battle, allies gain experience from dealing damage, receiving
           damage, healing and buffing their allies, and debuffing or impairing
           enemies. All allies also gain experience for finishing battles
           quickly, when there is a turn limit."

Tutorial: "After gaining enough experience, an ally will level up, improving
           each of their attributes by one. You also choose one attribute to be
           improved by an extra point."

Tutorial: "Each level up additionally grants the ally one skill point, which
           can be spent in the inventory to learn a new skill to use in battle."

Tutorial: "Every ally practices three 'Disciplines'. Each of their skills falls
           into a discipline. An ally's strength in a particular discipline
           is measured by the number of skills they've learned in that
           discipline."

Tutorial: "In addition to using up a skill point, each skill has discipline
           requirements that the ally must meet in order to learn it."

// If you talk to Kath

Kath: "The decision's yours. Your intuition has saved us enough times before."

// If you proceed north immediately until Elaine is in sight. She is by the
// trees.

Kath: "There, do you see that? At the edge of the trees. It looks like..."

A: A person

    Kath: "Yes, a girl! But it doesn't look like Shanti or Ceryl."

A: An animal

    Kath: ""

???: "And with any luck, one day we'll get a taste of the peace and tranquility
      you old geezers are always rattling on about. Ah, but I suspect there'll
      be plenty of terrifying monsters standing between us and that day."

Lester: "But if executioner Abelon is in good spirits and the charming Kath is
         caught sulking, people will think Eruta's turned upside down! More than
         it already has, anyway."

Kath: "The charming Kath? I'm charming now? Am I charming, Abelon?"

A: Positively captivating

    Lester: "Captain, I'm hearing a touch of sarcasm. It's coming from Captain
             Abelon's general direction."

    Kath: "Now that you mention it, I do believe you're right, Lester, I'm
           hearing it too."

A: Not on your life
