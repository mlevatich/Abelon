# 1-1 Script

## entry

The chapter begins over a black screen, with "1-1" displayed in the bottom-middle

A voice over the black screen:
```
Abelon (hidden): ...

Abelon (hidden): ............

Abelon (hidden): ...Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Abelon (hidden): ..................

Abelon (hidden): ..!
```

The scene slowly fades in, with the camera centered on Abelon in a forested clearing in the eastern part of the deep forest. Abelon stands in what appears to be a ritual circle. On the ground nearby is a small scroll. The player may control Abelon and wander around

## scroll

```
Scroll: An unfurled scroll lies among the twigs and leaves of the forest floor. It is full of strange drawings and scrawled paragraphs resembling instructions.

Scroll: The writing is faded and barely legible, and the parchment feels as though it would crumble to dust at the slightest gust of wind.

A: Pick it up

    -LABEL TAKE_SCROLL-

        Scroll: You carefully roll up the scroll and place it in your pack.

        -> Gain: Scroll

A: Leave it

    -> Callback:

        Scroll: The scroll rests unmoving on the ground.

        A: Pick it up

            -GOTO TAKE_SCROLL-
        
        A: Leave it
```

## medallion

```
Medallion: On the ground is a silver medallion, strung with a thin rope and smeared with dirt. The image of a round shield over a longsword is engraved in the metal.

A: Pick it up

    -LABEL TAKE_MEDALLION-

        Medallion: You brush the dirt off of the medallion and place it in your pack.

        -> Gain: Medallion

A: Leave it

    -> Callback:

        Medallion: The medallion glimmers on the forest floor, reflecting faint moonlight.

        A: Pick it up

            -GOTO TAKE_MEDALLION-
        
        A: Leave it
```

## igneashard

Igneashard: You happen upon a shard of ignea embedded in the ground.

A: Take it

    Igneashard: You wrest the shard from the earth and brush away the dirt before putting it in your pack.

    -> Gain: Igneashard

A: Leave it
```

## battle

If the player moves southwest into the south deep forest, they will come across a lone wolf, facing away from Abelon and towards Elaine's body on the ground. Moving near the wolf will cause the camera to center on it, and the wolf to turn and face Abelon. A battle initiates, with the preparation menu skipped and assists disabled

```
-> Event: Abelon and the wolf get into position before the fight begins

## elaine

```
Elaine (hidden): It's a young girl with fair skin and fiery hair, facedown on the ground. She wears the garb of a hunter, with a bow and quiver slung on her back. She has only minor injuries, but isn't moving.

-LABEL ELAINE_INTERACT-

    A: Leave her

    A: Shake her

        Elaine (hidden): You shake the girl gently, but she does not stir.

    *If !saw-camp*
    A: Carry her

        Elaine (hidden): With her equipment and bag, the girl is heavy and unwieldy to carry. You are not sure where you would take her to.

    *If saw-camp*
    A: Carry her to camp (Elaine +3)

        Elaine (hidden): With effort, you hoist the limp girl and her belongings onto your back.

        -> Event: Screen fades to black, Elaine and Abelon teleport to camp
        -> Set: carried-elaine

-> Callback:

    *If !carried-elaine*

        Elaine (hidden): The young girl is still motionless.

        -GOTO ELAINE_INTERACT-

    *If carried-elaine*
    
        Elaine (hidden): The girl lies on her side, taking shallow breaths. She is unconscious, but alive.    
```

## campfire

If the player moves further west from the battle site, to the west monastery approach, they will come across a camp in a clearing immediately south of the map transition to the monastery approach. This will prompt the camera to pan around. One unoccupied and three occupied camp beds surround an unlit campfire, with packs and camp trappings scattered about. North of the camp are stone reliefs that look like trail markers

```
Campfire: A campfire. The sticks are blackened, but hot coals still radiate light. It will die out before morning.
```

## camp-clutter

```
Campclutter: Someone cooked here.
```

## book

```
Book: A large book with sturdy but old pages lies open amidst the clutter of the campsite. It is too difficult to read in the faint moonlight.
```

## kath

```
Kath (hidden): A well-built man sleeps in the camp bed. His hand extends out of the bed and rests on a long spear, but a serene expression is just visible on his face, half-obscured by a tumble of thick black hair.
```

## lester

```
Lester (hidden): A pale man with blonde hair sleeps with a furrowed brow. He shifts in his camp bed, occasionally muttering something unintelligible.
```

## shanti

```
Shanti (hidden): A dark-skinned woman, the oldest of the three by some margin. Her breathing is steady and rhythmic, and her face betrays nothing but the peace of deep sleep.
```

## camp-bed

```
Campbed: An open camp bed. The exterior is made from leather, and the insides are filled with a soft material. It looks rather well-worn.

A: Continue looking around

    -> Callback:

        Campbed: The camp bed is still open. It doesn't appear anyone else will be using it.

        A: Continue looking around

        A: Go to sleep

            -LABEL SLEEP-

                -> Event: Screen fades to black

                Abelon (hidden): What is...?

                Abelon (hidden): ...Need... I can't...

                -> Event: "1-2" appears in the corner of the screen
                -> Transition: 1-2

A: Go to sleep

    -GOTO SLEEP-

*If !carried-elaine*
A: Kill them

    -> Event: A sound effect plays and the music stops. Abelon moves to the side of the camp. As he begins drawing his sword, the screen cuts to black

    Abelon (hidden): I see... Then I was overly concerned.

    Abelon (hidden): That is a relief.

    -> Event: "1-2" appears in the corner of the screen
    -> Transition: 1-5-a
