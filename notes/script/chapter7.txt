NOTES
*****

Abelon has basically taken control entirely by this point. If you make a decision, it is because he trusts you
and lets you.

Either put the messenger to sleep or kill it, outside the west gate at the Sonder.

A cool "power trip" idea for the final boss is when you're in dire straits, you suddenly get infinite
ignea and can go nuts.
