CHAPTER 7: The Waking World

*****
NOTES
*****

Abelon has basically taken control entirely by this point. If you make a decision, it is because he trusts you
and lets you.

Either put the messenger to sleep or kill it, outside the west gate at the Sonder.

You will have to fight Jericho here, who is determined to kill the messenger, unable to move past what it did to his men.
A tragic character to the end.

A cool "power trip" idea for the final boss is when you're in dire straits, you suddenly get infinite
ignea and can go nuts.

Abelon has some choice over who the next cardinal and caretaker will be. The options depend on impressions as well.
