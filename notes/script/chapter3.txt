CHAPTER 3: Across the Sonder
****************************



*****
NOTES
*****

Sonder is huge and full of stuff. Like a mini open world.

Kath can act as a narrator in the first half when Abelon doesn't talk much.

There are decisions on expeditions such as in the Sonder, but they won't cause fail states,
only provide certain rewards.

There is a New Years celebration on the road during expedition 1.
