CHAPTER 6: The Cardinal and the Caretaker
*****************************************



*****
NOTES
*****

Gaheris knows the secrets came from the past, so he goes to the ash archives by Lefellen. Big drain on kingdom
resources, but the king allows it (why?), upsetting everyone. In chapter 6, return home from ash after meeting up
with Gaheris, to find that the place is under attack. He found out the world is waking,  and we need to put it to
sleep by stopping the Messenger. He says it was defeated by the power of a demon inhabiting a great knight
but corrupting him, saving the world but turning the knight towards darkness. But the book of incantations for
summoning the demon was missing from the archives (because Abelon retrieved it before the story began).

To progress from this point, the player must retrieve the book of incantations from the summoning site.
If you've been good to Abelon, he'll let you read his diary hidden under the books.
Otherwise, he'll do it himself and leave the diary behind. If you've been good,
he'll also tell Gaheris that the demon was actually kind. Learning we have the demon on our side convinces
Gaheris we have a chance, but we need to confront the King to find out why he wanted the Caretaker and
Cardinals dead, but allowed Gaheris to investigate the archives.

Abelon makes a decision for you towards the end in a dramatic moment.

Need Gaheris and Luci to win the final battle of Chapter 3.

The late choices are about Kath, Gaheris, the King, and the Watchers.

Abelon takes more control by this point in the story.

The king's spies attack you when you go to confront him. Cool battle with people showing up in random spots every turn.
Actually the king is good so I might have to rethink this.
