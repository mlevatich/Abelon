CHAPTER 6: Two Captains
***********************



*****
NOTES
*****

Travel through the ruins of Lefally, heading southeast along the river back
towards Ebonach, at the urging of Gaheris. You've learned a lot now and have
some rough ideas of what needed to be done. You've learned that you were
supposed to subdue the messenger, but it's gone now, so it's unclear what will
happen. Will you succumb to despair?

This chapter focuses on Kath and Abelon. Kath reminisces about his past as you
travel the ruins of his home, and tells you about growing up with Abelon as a
mentor. Abelon talks a lot and reveals some of his innermost feelings too. The
captains are at their most vulnerable here, when all hope seems lost at the end
of the world.

There was an old bridge across the river Ebon, which you check out to see if you
can get back to the Sonder and approach the city from the west. The bridge is
long destroyed, however, so you have to go to the North forest and enter the
city from the North.

In the North Forest, as a final boss, fight the re-animated corpse of whoever
you left to die here in Chapter 1.
