CHAPTER 5: Secrets in Ash
*************************



*****
NOTES
*****

Gaheris is accompanied by the knight you didn't bring with you in chapter 1. If you saved all three, it will be whichever
knight you didn't order as backup to the Sonder on the doomed reinforcements mission (if there was only one choice
at this point, that knight would be reassigned to guard Gaheris to the Ash, and wouldn't have died on the reinforcements
mission).

Go back to the capital, stopping by the archives on the way, and meeting up with Gaheris.

Need to discover something new that even the King doesn't know â€“ combine your knowledge with his,
to make the trip worthwhile.

Abelon is talking about as much as the player by this point.
