CHAPTER 5: Doomed to Ash
************************



*****
NOTES
*****

The low point in the story. Traverse the canyon, starving, fending off monsters
and a drake, until you stumble on the archives.

You succeed in the landslide plan,
but block the party's path back to Mistram, so you must travel north through the
bottom of the ravine, searching for food and fleeing from a Drake (you can
also kill it, which Kath says will doom the world when it's mother finds out and
takes revenge, but this consequence never arises throughout the entire story).
Concerned only with survival, you fight monsters for food until reaching the
Archives west of Lefally, which mysteriously seems to have been recently
visited. Nobody except maybe Kath even knew this building existed. You run
unexpectedly into Gaheris, who shares his supply caravan with you and tells you
he was sent by the king.

You should run desperately low on ignea here.

Learn here that Mona is Kath's mother, and that Kath is a woman, and from
Lefally.

Gaheris is accompanied by the knight you didn't bring with you in chapter 1. Both
join your party at the archives.

Need to discover something new that even the King doesn't know â€“ combine your
knowledge with his, to make the trip worthwhile. Exploring the archives gives
you a MOSTLY complete picture of the story and the history of the Kingdom.

Oops, you weren't supposed to kill the messenger.

Abelon is talking about as much as the player by this point. Perhaps a little less.
