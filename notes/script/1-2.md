# 1-2 Script

## Introduction

*The chapter begins over a black screen, with "1-2" displayed in the bottom-middle.*

Kath speaks:
```
???: Abelon, wake up. Quickly.

???: And fetch your scabbard. Abelon?

-> Event: Scene fades in. Abelon and Kath stand outside of their camp beds. Kath has his weapon drawn. If carried-elaine, she is also nearby. The other two camp beds are empty.

???: Can you sense it? They're hanging back for now, watching us. But they'll attack soon enough.

A: Yes

A: What?

    ???: Wolves, Abelon. Hurry and shake off whatever dreams you were having, and draw your sword.

-> Event: Abelon draws his sword.

???: Ach, this is exactly what I was afraid would happen. Can't Lester ever just sit still? Blasted fool.

A: Where are they?

    -LABEL A-
    ???: Lester woke up early and announced he was heading towards the ruins to start looking for the ritual site. I told him it was idiotic to go alone, of course, but he wasn't having it.

    ???: More likely is he didn't want to linger around camp with you here. I'm sure you're aware he's not exactly fond of you.

    A: An understatement

        ???: Well, I can only assure you it wasn't my influence. He may be a knight under my command, but I didn't teach him to disrespect you.

        A: Naturally

            ???: Naturally...

        A: I appreciate it (Kath +1i)

            ???: You appreciate that I... haven't been slandering you behind your back.
            
            ???: I suppose I shouldn't be surprised your standards are low for such things.

        A: So you're an admirer of mine? (Kath +1a)

            ???: Ha.

    A: Is he not? (Kath +1a)

        ???: Are you... Was that a joke, old man? We've heard nothing but dour muttering and veiled insults from him ever since he was assigned to this expedition.

        ???: One would think he'd be honored to have been chosen to join us. But having to take orders from Captain Abelon has ruined it for him, I suppose.

        A: You sound resentful

            ???: Yes, that I have to listen to his complaining. But don't mistake me – he's served under me for years, and we've been friends for even longer. It would be more odd if he didn't annoy me time and again.

            ???: He's a peerless warrior. Present company excluded, of course. But I'm grateful to have him along.

        A: He should count himself lucky

            ???: Hm. Does a knight ever consider himself lucky to be given a task of unparalleled danger? There's no guarantee that this ritual works, or that we even return alive... But I digress.

    A: He has no right (Abelon +1)

        ???: I couldn't disagree more, Abelon. History will judge whether His Majesty made the right decision, but what it put Lester's family through... no one should have to endure that.

        A: Yet he became a knight

            ???: On the condition that he would serve under me, and not you, yes. And he rather quickly became my best warrior. But one does wonder why he would volunteer to directly serve the King, after all that happened.

        A: Many have endured worse

            ???: And so will affairs in the city continue, until the shroud of Despair is lifted from Ebonach and monsters plague us no more. On that, at least, we will always agree.

    A: I can hardly blame him (Kath +1a)

        ???: I'm... surprised to hear you say that. You've not once seemed apologetic about the whole affair in the entire time I've known you.

        A: I'm not, but I understand his anger

            ???: Yes, it was... awful. For everyone involved. I know His Majesty felt it was necessary but... ah, it's not the time nor place to dwell on it.

        A: It was a mistake (Kath +1a, Abelon -1)

            -> Flag: abelon-mistake

            ???: ...

            ???: Do you... actually mean that? By the goddess, it's like you've woken up a different person. I don't believe it... and I wonder how Lester would react...

A: Who are you? (Kath +1a, Abelon -1)

    ???: What? Goddess, Abelon, wake yourself up already! You aren't old enough to be getting senile yet! Here, you were asleep, so I'll fill you in.

    -GOTO A-

*If not carried-elaine*
???: In any case, since there was no swaying him, I had Shanti go with him. Better that we move in pairs, in the event that... something exactly like this happens.

*otherwise*
???: In any case, since there was no swaying him, I had Shanti go with him. She was dreadfully curious about this child you brought back to camp, of course, but we'll have to discuss further when we rejoin them.

???: I've healed her internal injuries, but she hasn't yet woken up. I must say, I'm terribly interested in who she is as well. And how you came to bring her here...

-> Event: The screen pans around. Three wolves emerge from the forest.

???: Time enough for talking later. Here they come.
```

## Battle 1-2

*The player enters the battle preparation menu. Abelon and Kath are next to each other, with four wolves surrounding them. The enemies are positioned such that it is impossible to win the battle in fewer than three turns, even on Normal. Two wolves flank Abelon and Kath from the sides, while the other two are together, further southwest.*

A battle tutorial appears on the right side of the screen during ally phase 1:
```
After using an attack or spell and finishing their movement, an ally may use an 'Assist' skill, aimed at some set tiles.

Until the next ally phase, any ally standing on an assisted tile benefits from the effects of the skill. Numerical effects are calculated from the caster's attributes.

Position allies to attack from tiles with offensive assists, or end their actions on tiles with defensive assists. With three or more allies, one unit can even benefit from multiple assists at the same time.
```

Ally phase 1 begins:
```
???: Right, we'll do the usual song and dance then. The young upstart will take his orders from the grumpy old man.

Kath: Captain Kath of Lefellen, at your command!
```

First time selecting Abelon or Kath:
```
Kath: We ought to stay close if possible, so we can assist each other.

Kath: We're surrounded, but we can't let them attack as a group... Best to strike quickly and finish off one of them to buy ourselves some space.
```

Abelon uses Conflagration or Crucible for the first time
```
-> Set: kath-saw-spell

Kath: By Ignus, what the hell did you just do, Abelon? I've never seen such unbelievable magic!

A: You haven't? (Kath +1a)

    Kath: No, I haven't, in all the countless battles I've fought by your side. You aren't really trying to tell me you've been conjuring hellfire all this time and I just wasn't paying attention!

A: A useful spell I recently learned

    Kath: ...You have a habit of understating things somewhat.

Kath: Well, I insist you teach me that incantation when we return to town.

Kath: Oh, but don't waste your entire supply of Ignea on a mere few wolves. I expect we'll face many more battles before we return to Ebonach, and I can tell that was no cheap cantrip.
```

Kath dies:
```
Kath: Urgh. Damn, hurts........ But I refuse... to........
```

Abelon dies:
```
Kath: Abelon, no! NO!
```

Enemy phase 1 begins:
```
Kath: Watch yourself, Abelon!
```

An ignea tutorial appears on the right side of the screen during ally phase 2, replacing the assist tutorial:
```
Many powerful skills consume Ignea, listed as their 'Cost'. Ignea is a precious stone, and each unit in battle has a limited supply, shown in their Attributes.

Be careful with these skills – to recover Ignea, you will have to find it on your journey.

On Master difficulty, no Ignea is restored after battle / On Adept difficulty, 25% of each ally's maximum Ignea is restored after battle / On Normal difficulty, 50% of each ally's maximum Ignea is restored after battle
```

Ally phase 3 begins and carried-elaine:
```
???: Mmh...

Kath: About time she started coming to. Hm, I wonder...

???: W-where am I? What's going on?

Kath: Sensible questions, but we don't have time to answer them until we've dealt with these wolves. What I want to know is, can you help?

???: Help? W-what?

Kath: You have a bow, and arrows. I assume you're familiar with how to use them.

???: Bow and... Oh Goddess, you want me to fight? I...

A: Your assistance would be welcome (Elaine +1)

A: We can't trust her (Abelon +1)

    Kath: What, you think she's our enemy? I have a hard time believing that, given the state you brought her in. I would expect more competence from a spy or traitor.

A: Kath, she's a child (Abelon -1, Kath +1a)

    Kath: And what are you, her mother? All three of us are in danger, and child or not, she has a weapon.

A: ...

Kath: Miss, if you fight, we'll protect you.

???: I've never shot a w-wolf before. They're... Goddess, they're terrifying up close... But...

???: ...Ok. I can help. I'm ready.

Kath: Look at that, Abelon! She's only just woken up, but she has a knight's courage. Lucky us.

Kath: Listen to me. Shoot them while they're circling one of us, and go for the kill, or you'll risk drawing their attention to you. We can parry their fangs – you can't.

???: R-right. Ok... Pretend it's a rabbit... Like shooting a rabbit... Breathe deep...

-> Event: Elaine joins the party, and the battle
```

Elaine dies:
```
???: Ahhh!

Kath: Damnit, no! We couldn't protect her...
```

Ally phase 3 begins and not carried-elaine:
```
-> Event: Screen pans southeast to reveal Elaine walking slowly.

???: I'm sure it was... this way... ...What? Are they... fighting? They must be the ones...

Kath: What the– Abelon! There's a person! A young girl, do you see her? By the Goddess, what is she doing out here?

A: I came across her last night (Kath +1a)

    -> Set: kath-knows-found-elaine

    Kath: You what? Abelon, we're two days out from town! Did you not think it was worth stopping to help her, or at least waking up the camp to inform us?

    A: I assumed she was dead

        Kath: A reasonable assumption this far from Ebonach, but given that she clearly isn't a rotting corpse, you might've at least checked...

    A: The King's graces do not extend past the city limits (Abelon +1, Kath -1i)

        Kath: I understand she's in violation of the Kingdom's laws, but isn't it more important that she's alone and clearly in need of help? Honestly, Abelon, I'll never understand you...

A: Kath. Eyes on the enemy (Abelon +1)

    Kath: Yes, of course, I'm just... the last thing I expected to see was another person this deep in the forest...

Kath: Ach, we'll deal with her after the wolves are dead. Hopefully she doesn't draw any attention to herself.
```

On ally phase 3, the Attributes tutorial is shown on the right, replacing the Ignea tutorial:
```
The capabilities of a unit are summarized by their 'Attributes'.

Endurance determines a unit's maximum health, and Focus determines their maximum Ignea usage.

Force determines the effectiveness of many attacks and spells, and Affinity determines the effectiveness of many assists.

Every point of Reaction reduces Weapon Damage by one. Spell Damage bypasses Reaction.

Every four points of Agility confers one tile of movement in battle.
```

On ally phase 4, the following message replaces the tutorials:
```
All battle tutorials are now available for review under 'Tutorials' in the 'Settings' menu.

To access the 'Settings' and other game information during battle, select any empty tile by pressing F.
```

After victory:
```
Kath: *Huff* Hah, it's over. Poor beasts. Someone should have told them they were picking a fight with the greatest knights in all the Kingdom!

A: The greatest knights?

    Kath: What, you disagree?

    A: I suppose not (Kath +1i)

        Kath: Precisely.

    A: You aren't yet worthy of that title

        Kath: Bah! Says the old man to the youngest Knight Captain in the Kingdom's history. And it won't be long before I finally best you in a proper duel, either. Time is on my side, Abelon.

    A: I'm not quite worthy of that title (Kath +1a, Abelon -1)

        Kath: ...You can't really mean that, can you? If there isn't a knight in Ebonach who can match you in a duel, who exactly are you competing with?

        Kath: Unless you think the title of "greatest" demands a winning personality. In which case, yes, you're dead last.

*If not carried-elaine*
A: Kath, the girl

    Kath: Of course.

A: ...

Kath: Now then...
```

## Dealing with Elaine

Post-battle dialogue for 1-2
```
*If carried-elaine*

    Kath: That was fine work, Elaine. I'm impressed you kept your nerve, if that was your first proper combat with monsters.

    Elaine: I... um...

    A: You have a lot of explaining to do (Abelon +1)

        Kath: Indeed she does, but hold off on the interrogation for a moment, old man. I need to check her wounds. She was in quite a state when you brought her here.

    A: Kath, check her injuries (Kath +1i, Elaine +1)

        Kath: As if I need you to remind me. She was in quite a state when you brought her here.

*If not carried-elaine*

    Kath: Excuse me, miss? Are you alright?

    A: She's injured (Elaine +1)

    A: Be careful, it might be a trap (Abelon +1)

        Kath: I doubt it. Look at her, old man, she can barely stand. She needs our help. And we need to know what she's doing in the middle of the valley, whether or not you particularly care for her well-being.

    Elaine: ...Is it over? Are we safe?

    Kath: Yes, the monsters are gone. For now.
    
    Elaine: ...Please, help me. I'm lost. If you have food, or medicine, I'll find a way to repay you, I promise...

    Kath: Not to worry, I'm trained in healing magic. You're lucky to have happened upon us. Come, sit at our camp. I'll get you some food as well. What's your name?

    Elaine: Oh... thank you. Thank you! I knew if I followed the tracks I would find someone, and I did it! I'll be able to go home... I'm Elaine.

    Elaine: It's such a relief to see someone, after all this time... Wait. The both of you, don't I know...?
    
    Elaine: Oh. Oh goddess, you're-

    Kath: Elaine, is it? Hold still for a moment, Elaine, I'm going to heal some of your wounds. Thankfully none of them appear serious.

Kath: ...Right. 'For simple cuts and bruises, slowly guide a fist of thumb-sized stones over the length of the wound, while channeling power gently into the wrist and reading the listed incantation... Replace with new stones when half depleted'... Hm, I wonder if I could recite all of the healing scripts from memory.

A: Impressive recollection (Kath +1i)

    Kath: On the topic of my memory, old man, I haven't forgotten my first battle at the Southwall under your command, when you told the other knights, 'Kath ought to make an easy meal for the monsters - he won't notice his head's being chewed off until he realizes he can't see his manuscript'.

    A: And it was true, at the time

        Kath: Perhaps, perhaps not. But you won't deny it's serving me well now; even without any scripts handy, a little field healing for Elaine here is child's play.

    A: I said such a thing? (Kath +1a)

        Kath: You did, and everyone laughed themselves hoarse over it. I didn't mind that it was at my expense, of course. I suspect I only remember it because it was the first time I heard you make a joke about anything.

A: You learned something at the academy after all.

    Kath: Not so! Sitting at a desk never taught me a thing. Protecting the farmers along the Southwall under your command was when it all started to stick.

A: Are you just showing off? (Kath -1i)

    Kath: No, I'm trying to recall the particulars of one of a few hundred ignaeic spellcasting methods pulled from twenty different manuscripts. Unless you'd rather I make a mistake and set her on fire?

A: ... (Abelon +1)

*If carried-elaine*

    Elaine: Th-thank you. For taking care of me, and for saving me last night. That wolf would have surely killed me... Fighting with you was the least I could do. Even though I didn't help much...

    Kath: Hold on, what wolf? What exactly happened last night, old man? After I woke you up for the second watch I slept straight through until morning. Imagine my surprise, waking up to an unconscious, injured girl in camp with us!

*If not carried-elaine*

    Elaine: Th-thank you. For taking care of me, and for saving me last night. That wolf would have surely killed me...

    *If not kath-knows-found-elaine*
    Kath: Hold on, what wolf? Abelon, did something happen last night? After I woke you up for the second watch I slept straight through until morning.

    *If kath-knows-found-elaine*
    Kath: Hold on, what wolf? Abelon, you told me you saw her last night. What exactly happened? After I woke you up for the second watch I slept straight through until morning.

A: I left camp for a clearing to the east (Kath +1a, Abelon -1)

    Kath: What? Abelon, you had the watch! I'm never one to doubt your intuition, but you should have woken me. What could possibly have been so urgent?

    A: A ritual, performed under the moonlight (Abelon -1)

        Kath: For what purpose? And why didn't you tell us?

        A: It granted knowledge of new combat spells

            *If kath-saw-spell*
            Kath: Ah. Then that explains the destructive fire you unleashed upon those poor wolves earlier. You burnt them to a crisp. Useful magic, no doubt. But why didn't you tell us you were preparing such a ritual? We might have helped.

            *If not kath-saw-spell*
            Kath: New combat spells, hm? That does sound useful, but why didn't you tell us you were preparing such a ritual? We might have helped.

            A: Secrecy was a requirement (Abelon -1)

                Kath: A component of the ritual specifically required you not to discuss it with anyone? That seems awfully... arbitrary.
                
                Kath: Then again, Shanti was just telling us yesterday about the month in which she waited every day for a bird to land on her head, just to fulfill a ritual's instructions... It's baffling magic, I don't mind saying. I'll stick to my simple incantations.

                Kath: Hopefully the ritual our party is meant to perform at this supposed monastery isn't so complicated.

            A: I don't know (Abelon -2, Kath +2a, Kath -1i)

                -GOTO Y-

        A: I don't know (Abelon -2, Kath +2a, Kath -1i)

            -LABEL Y-
            Kath: You... don't know? Abelon, you aren't making any sense. What's going on here? Are you feeling alright?

            A: ...

            A: ...

            A: ...

            Kath: I don't like the look you're giving me... Fine, I'll drop it. You've made me party to enough of your secrets and half-truths in the past, and they've always been for good reason.

            Kath: But as much as I'm not fond of witholding information from our knights or our people, it stings even worse to be the one kept in the dark... Goddess grant that one day you and King Sinclair trust me to the extent you trust each other.
        
        Kath: In any case, I'm to presume on your way to the clearing you happened upon little Elaine here?

        Elaine: Yes, that must be why you found me... I wasn't anywhere near here. At least, I don't think so. I would have seen the light from the fire.

    A: Someone was in danger (Elaine +1)

        -> Set: sensed-elaine

        Kath: But... that clearing isn't even within earshot from here. Did you use some sort of spell of detection to survey the area? You ought to teach it to me, if so.

        Elaine: That must be how you found me. You came to my rescue.

A: I sensed someone nearby

    -> Set: sensed-elaine

    Kath: What? Abelon, you had the watch! I'm never one to doubt your intuition, but you should have woken me. Did you really leave the camp undefended?

    A: Only for a brief moment (Kath +1a)

        Kath: You would have cursed me with all of the air in your lungs had I done something so careless. It's unlike you...

    A: She was in danger, it was urgent (Elaine +1)

        Kath: You were able to ascertain all that just sitting beside our dying campfire in the middle of the night?
        
    Kath: She must have been nearly within sight of us. Or else you used some spell of detection to survey the area? You ought to teach it to me, if so.

    Elaine: Um... I wasn't anywhere near here. At least, I don't think so. I would have seen the light from the fire.

Elaine: It had just gotten dark... I was hungry and tired, I was looking for somewhere to rest. Then I saw... these red eyes, staring at me from the trees... I was so scared, I started running away, and I think it was chasing after me.

Elaine: I was looking behind me, searching for it, and then... I don't remember anything else. I woke up and I was here.

Kath: Perhaps you ran into a tree, or tripped, and the blow knocked you unconscious. That would explain the wounds on your head and face.

*If carried-elaine*
Elaine: Goddess, I've been an embarassment... Grandad would have my hide. But, the wolf...

*If not carried-elaine*
Elaine: Goddess, I've been an embarassment... Grandad would have my hide. But, when I woke up I saw a wolf near me, dead. You saved me, didn't you?

*If not sensed-elaine*
A: The wolf was blocking my path, so I killed it

    *If carried-elaine*

        Kath: At least you had the good sense to bring her back to camp. Do you remember some months ago, when we were stretched thin out beyond Ebonach's west gate? You fought bitterly against my carrying home a dying knight. Has your heart softened since then?

        A: I'm not nearly as soft-hearted as you (Kath +1i)

            Kath: Ha! As it should be.

            -GOTO ZZ-

        A: She's here because we need to question her (Abelon +1, Elaine -1)

            -GOTO Z-

    *If not carried-elaine*

        Kath: Thank the Goddess she was able to reach our camp safely. I can't fathom why you didn't bring her back, Abelon. She was unconscious and defenseless!

        -LABEL ZZZ-

        Kath: ...Sigh. At least she's here now. I expect she's exhausted, but I'm sure you'd agree, Abelon, that some questions are in order.

*If sensed-elaine and not carried-elaine*
A: I killed the wolf before it could attack you (Kath +1a, Elaine +1)

    Kath: And yet you didn't bother to bring her back to our camp, even though she was still unconscious and defenseless. Were you ever planning to raise this with our party? Were you expecting her to simply find her way here unassisted?

    -GOTO ZZZ-

*If carried-elaine*
A: I killed the wolf and carried you here to safety (Elaine +1, Kath +1a)

    Elaine: Thank you. Again. Thank you...

    Kath: Why, your hard heart is beginning to soften after all, old man! It was only some months ago, when we were stretched thin out beyond Ebonach's west gate, that you fought bitterly against my carrying home a dying knight. Could it be that my heroism and effortless charisma are rubbing off on you?

    A: Don't look so smug (Kath +1i)

    A: ...

    -LABEL ZZ-

    Kath: Well, now that she's safe with us, I believe some questions are in order.

*If carried-elaine*
A: I killed the wolf and brought you here to question you (Abelon +1, Elaine -1)

    -LABEL Z-

    Kath: Thinking tactically, as always.

Kath: Elaine, you're a citizen of Ebonach, aren't you?

Elaine: Yes.

Kath: Then I take it you already know who we are.

*If carried-elaine*
Elaine: ...I thought I didn't, when I was just waking up. But you called him Abelon. And I realized that I recognized you, both of you, I just... didn't believe it. That I had been rescued by the two Knight Captains. I've only ever seen either of you from a distance...

*If not carried-elaine*
Elaine: ...I thought I didn't, when I first saw you. But I've never seen anyone fight so fiercely, or quickly, and I realized that I recognized you, both of you, I just... didn't believe it. That I had been found by the two Knight Captains. I've only ever seen either of you from a distance...

Elaine: Captain Kath, Sir... I hope that my, um, plain speech hasn't offended you in any way. And thank you, Sir Kath, for using your magic to heal me. Please forgive me for being a distraction from your, uh, quest. Or whatever.

Kath: Ha! I must admit, I don't mind the deferential treatment. If only Lester and Shanti were so enthusiastic... But Elaine, there's no need to fuss over your words-

Elaine: And Sir Abelon, please accept my gratitude. I didn't deserve to be saved by a famous knight. I didn't deserve to be saved at all, I know... I don't... I should have died. I should be dead. For being stupid.

Elaine: But Captain Abelon, Sir, please, uh... I'm sorry...

Elaine: Will you spare my life? I... I just want to go home. I won't go out into the forest again, just please, let me go back home to my grandfather...

A: What? I saved you from that wolf, didn't I? (Kath +1i, Elaine +1)

    Elaine: Yes, and I'll answer your questions, and uh... then you'll know that I was out in the forest without permission and, and, it's against the law and I got in your way and grandad said if you get in Sir Abelon's way he'll probably, he'll probably kill you, and I, I... *sob*

    Kath: Sigh... You see, Abelon? This is what you've done to our reputation. This poor girl is convinced you'll kill her in cold blood right after saving her life.

    Kath: Every time His Majesty orders an execution in the name of "safeguarding the Kingdom", I have to go out into the streets smiling and waving and giving candies to children just to convince our own public that the Knights of Ebonach do more than go around chopping peoples' heads off!

    A: Nobody is forcing you

        Kath: I'm forcing myself. I love this Kingdom, Abelon, and I know you do too, in your own twisted way. I became a knight to protect it. But I want more for it than survival. I want its people to be happy. You and King Sinclair don't seem to feel the same way, so it falls to me.

    A: That's absurd, I would never kill someone in Elaine's position (Kath +1a, Kath +1i)

        Kath: You would never, except for all of the times you have. Either on His Majesty's orders or your own judgement.
    
    Elaine: I'm sorry. Sir Kath, Sir Abelon, I'm sorry. I was overwhelmed, is all. But both of you... you're very different in person. From how I imagined. Please, let me explain how I ended up here.

A: Stop blubbering and tell us why you're here (Abelon +1, Kath -1i, Elaine -4)

    Elaine: R-right. Right.

Elaine: My house is near the north gate of Ebonach. I... Sometimes I go into the valley with my bow and arrows. My grandad made them for me. Meat is so expensive at the market, but there are rabbits just outside the walls, and my grandad... I mean, I know how to hunt and trap them.

Kath: ...

Elaine: Yesterday was my little brother Charim's birthday, and I wanted to make him something special for dinner. So I went out...

Kath: Sorry to interrupt, but how exactly are you leaving the city? Two of my men guard the north gate.

Elaine: One of the knights there is... Um... We're friends. I go out at night, and he told me how to slip through without anyone noticing.

Kath: I'll have to have more than a few words with them...

Elaine: I went out, and I was checking my traps, and I saw a deer. I hardly ever see them anymore, they're so rare... I thought it would be so amazing if I could kill it, but I missed my first shot, and it ran away. When I went after it, I got lost.

Kath: Simply getting lost isn't enough to end up an entire two days' journey out from Ebonach.

Elaine: Well, I couldn't retrace my steps, but I did find a path. And I saw that people had been walking on it recently. My gran... Uh, I know how to track animals. I assumed the direction they were headed was back towards the city, since the valley is so dangerous...

Kath: Ah. But in fact, those were our footsteps, headed directly into the heart of the forest. I take it you didn't have a compass to orient yourself. And the trees obscure the sun at most hours... Bad luck.

Elaine: Eventually I realized I was getting further from town, but I was so hungry, and scared... it had already been a day, I... I had to sleep in a tree trunk in the dark... I thought if I could just catch up to the people walking on the path they could help me.

A: It's remarkable you made it this far (Elaine +1)

    Kath: I have to agree.

A: You've broken several laws (Abelon +1)

    Elaine: I... I know...

    Kath: True enough. But we aren't exactly in a position to bring her to justice, whatever the worth in doing so. More than her flagrant disrespect for the law, I'm interested in her genuine talents.

A: What a ridiculous story (Abelon +1, Elaine -1)

    Elaine: It's true! I'm not lying!

    Kath: It does stretch credulity, Abelon, but I'm inclined to believe her. Noticeable omissions regarding her grandfather aside...
    
    Elaine: Please, don't do anything to him! Hunting in the valley was allowed when he was young, I know it was! He was just trying to keep me entertained, I'm sure... What I did was my own fault.

    Kath: Rest easy. Personally, I've no interest in lecturing a man three times my age on the letter of the law. And I'll keep Abelon off his back. I'm more curious about you, and your genuine talents.

Kath: Elaine, to make it here, for two days you've steered clear of monsters, tracked both humans and animals, and kept yourself fed. What's more, you're proficient with a bow. And you aren't even a trained knight. How old are you?

Elaine: Seventeen.

Kath: Hm...

A: What are you plotting, Kath?

A: She's not coming with us (Elaine -1, Kath -1i)

    Kath: Come on now, you haven't even heard my proposal yet!

Kath: She's clearly capable. Enough that she wouldn't slow us down as a traveling companion. And she would be safer staying with us than trekking back to the city alone along the Lefally road.

Kath: I think we should bring her onto our expedition, find the monastery, and return home as a group after we finish with the ritual. That is, if she doesn't object.

Elaine: That's... Um...

A: Out of the question, she's a liability (Elaine -3, Abelon +1, Kath -1i)

A: We don't have enough rations or ignea (Elaine -1)

A: She'd be no safer with us (Kath +1a)

*If you didn't say "She's not coming with us" and Elaine impression is >= -1*
A: It merits discussion (Elaine +1, Abelon -1, Kath +1a)

Elaine: I...

*If Elaine impression < 0*

    Elaine: ...I'm sorry... Please, allow me to go back to Ebonach... I can find my way along the path. All I need is some food to take with me, if you can spare it. I want to go home.

    Kath: Truly? Elaine, do you understand how lucky you were just to reach us alive? Packs of wolves hunt all over the forest. And much worse. There's a reason it's barred to citizens. You'll be alone for a full two days, or longer if you run into trouble–

    Elaine: Stop! ...I know it's dangerous. And I'm scared, but... Well, I can tell when I'm not wanted. I don't really understand what you're doing in the valley, but if Captain Kath and Captain Abelon are both so far from the city, it must be important.

    Elaine: You already went to the trouble of saving my life. I don't want to cause any more problems, and Sir Abelon... you've made it clear that I would, if I stayed.

    Elaine: Whatever punishment you have for me when you come back to Ebonach, I accept it. Until then, I want to be with my family.

    Kath: Ach... It doesn't sound like I'll be swaying you. But I won't let you go unprepared.

    -GOTO FF-

*If 0 <= Elaine impression <= 5*

    Elaine: ...I'm just not sure. Fighting more monsters and getting further from home, or going back alone... Both sound terrifying. I'm already in debt to both of you, so I don't think it's my place to decide. I'll do whatever you believe is best.

    Kath: Personally, I think she'd be safe with us. And she can fight, with that bow of hers. Abelon?

        -GOTO II-

    A: How would we feed her?

        Kath: Well, Elaine, how did you feed yourself in the valley? You can't have made it this far on just a full stomach.

        Elaine: Berries, mostly. A lot of them grow around here. I didn't eat very much, to be honest... If I wasn't trying so hard to catch up with you, I would have shot a rabbit and made a fire to cook it. I've done that a few times before.

        Kath: Sounds like you're plenty capable of earning your weight in rations, then. So to speak. So long as there's a spare moment to forage...

            Kath: But Elaine, I won't let you go unprepared.

        *If carried-elaine*
        Kath: The same way we just did, naturally. By fighting cautiously and giving her strict orders. Two things you're rather well known for, I might add.

        Kath: It's true we're ill-informed of the dangers that lie deeper in the valley. But we're only a party of the three strongest knights in Ebonach, and perhaps its most skilled mage. Do you really doubt our ability to keep one girl alive?

        Elaine: ...Wow.

        -GOTO UU-

    A: How would she keep up with us?

        *If carried-elaine*

            Kath: You saw her fight just now. She has a knack for it, and the survival skills to match. Even if she's untrained, I don't think she'll hamper our progress. How about it, Elaine? At our next run-in with monsters, could you pull that off again?

            Elaine: With you protecting me, Sir Kath, I could. I was scared at first, but... The wolves are easy targets. Easier than rabbits, anyway.

        *If not carried-elaine*

            Kath: Well, she did catch up to us on the road. So her stamina and survival skills aren't in question, at least. But she'd have to hold her own in a proper fight against monsters.
            
            Kath: What do you think, Elaine? You have a bow and arrows. Imagine you were fighting with us just now. Could you have kept out of reach of the wolves' fangs and taken a few shots at them?

            Elaine: ...Oh Goddess. If... If a wolf ran for me, I don't know what I would do. But... they're much bigger than rabbits. If you distracted them, Sir Kath, I'm sure I could hit them.

            A: Imagination isn't enough, real combat is different (Abelon +1)

            A: ...

                Kath: Whether you'd keep your nerve in a real battle remains to be seen. Many knights don't.

            Elaine: ...I know what I must look like to you, Sir Kath, Sir Abelon. I've been scared, and confused, and desperate. But I can handle myself. Except for your knights, I've been in the valley more than anyone. I'll fight, if you need me to.

    *If said 'it merits discussion'*
    A: We'll take the risk, she comes with us

*If Elaine impression > 5*

    Elaine: I want to join you. The thought of going back to the city alone is... It's too much. I feel safe here with you, Sir Kath and Sir Abelon. You've looked out for me, and been considerate towards me. You're different from how I thought Knights of Ebonach would be.

    *If carried-elaine*
    Elaine: And I won't slow you down! I can fight, you saw me fight! And, and... I'll hunt for food for us! So that there's still enough for everyone! Please, give me a chance.

    *If not carried-elaine*
    Elaine: And I won't slow you down! I can fight, I'm good with a bow, I promise! And, and... I'll hunt for food for us! So that there's still enough for everyone! Please, give me a chance.

    Kath: Well, now! Not just capable, but motivated! I dare say, far from a liability, she'd make a useful ally. What do you make of it, Abelon?

    A: I helped her. I didn't agree to have her tag along (Elaine -1)

        Kath: Maybe so, but what concerns have you raised that she doesn't have an answer for?

        A: Slowing down our progress

            Elaine: If I make trouble for your mission, or quest, or whatever it is, you can leave me behind. But first, let me prove myself. When I shoot my bow, I never miss. Er, except for that deer I was chasing...

        A: Our food supply

            Elaine: On my way here, I had to find food for two whole days. I know which plants are edible, and I know how to catch and cook rabbits. So long as there's a spare moment to forage, I can feed myself.

        A: Our ignea supply

            Elaine: Erm... I've never used magic outside of the academy. You don't need to share any spellstone with me.

        A: Her own safety (Elaine +1)

            Kath: It's true we're ill-informed of the dangers that lie deeper in the valley. But we're only a party of the three strongest knights in Ebonach, and perhaps its most skilled mage. Do you really doubt our ability to keep one girl alive?

            Elaine: Wow...

        Kath: I understand your hesitation, Abelon, but I think Elaine has made enough of a case for herself. I'm loathe to pull rank, but I'm a Knight Captain, same as you, and only His Majesty can overrule me. You might be leader of the expedition, but I'm making this call.

    A: ...Fine (Abelon -1)

    *If you didn't say it was out of the question*
    A: I'm convinced (Elaine +1, Kath +1i, Abelon -1)

    -GOTO SS-

-LABEL SS-

    Kath: It's decided. Elaine, you'll join us until we've achieved our goals in the valley and can go home.

    Elaine: Sir Kath, Sir Abelon, you've already done so much for me... I won't let you down.

    Elaine: Ah... So, what are those goals? Why are you both in the Red Mountain Valley? I didn't think the Knights of Ebonach ever went north anymore. And you're the Knight Captains... Don't you usually have a lot of knights with you to order around?

    Kath: Did you not see the news of His Majesty's announcement? It was circulated all over the city, from what I understand.

    Elaine: My grandad, um... He doesn't... I mean, he told me not to listen to any... Uh...

    Kath: He told you that King Sinclair has lost his mind, and that you shouldn't trust the palace or the Knights of Ebonach?

    Elaine: ...Please, don't-

    Kath: It's perfectly alright. You have no idea, Elaine, how often Abelon and I hear similar remarks. We tell our knights to ignore them. Ach, I tell mine that, anyway.

    Elaine: I'm sorry...

    Kath: Since you haven't heard, it will take some time to explain. But we ought to be seeking out our other two traveling companions, my knight and good friend Lester, and our resident ignaeic scholar Shanti.

    Kath: They went north ahead of us towards our destination. I'll fill you in while we retrace their steps. Abelon, we'll leave on your command.

-LABEL FF-

    Kath: Let me get you some of our rations. And a compass. Come have a look at this map.

    *Elaine and Kath move over to the campsite*
    
    Kath: We're here, where Shanti's drawn a little campfire. We've gone off the main Lefally road looking for a monastery, but if you walk southeast of here, you'll find a number of fallen trees. From there, you should see the path we cut through the brush.

    Kath: If you follow that path southwest, you'll reach the Lefally road by afternoon. It's a straight shot south on that road to the north gate of Ebonach. Shout down the guards, they'll let you in. After all, it sounds like you have a rather close friend among them.

    Elaine: ...

    Kath: ...Just a little joke! Anyway, keep your eyes open for wolves. They'll stalk you before going in for the attack. But if you notice them watching you and get yourself up a tall tree, they won't be able to reach. They should give up on you after a while.

    Elaine: ...Ok. What about other monsters?

    Kath: ...Ah.

    Kath: Pray you don't run into any.

    Elaine: ...

    Kath: I wish I had better advice for you. If it's any consolation, our band of four has seen nothing but wolves so far. There aren't many... other monsters this close to the Lefally road. Try not to dwell on it.

    Kath: Here, put these in your pack. Best that you start moving now, while it's still early.
    
    Elaine: ...Right. I think I have everything I need.
    
    Kath: In a couple of days, you'll be home safe and sound.

    A: Best of luck (Kath +1i)

    A: Get on with it (Abelon +1, Kath -1i)

    Elaine: Sir Kath... Thank you. Goodbye.

    *Elaine leaves to the east*

    Kath: ...

    Kath: ...Time for us to be moving on as well.

## Free roam

// Next to the campsite is a large open book. Interacting with it starts the following dialogue.
```
Book: A large book with sturdy but old pages lies open amidst the clutter of the campsite.

A: Start reading

    -LABEL B-
    Book: The open, two-page spread is taken up entirely by a map hand-drawn in ink. It depicts a winding valley of trees vertically dividing two large mountain ranges.
    
    Book: Near the top of the page is a drawing of a city in the valley labeled "Lefellen". The valley and mountains appear to extend further north past Lefellen, off the page.

    Book: To the south, the mountain ranges end and the valley of trees opens into a wide plain. At the mouth of the valley is depicted a larger, walled city. Printed next to the city is the label "Ebonach".

    Book: A river, originating from somewhere in the mountains, passes by Ebonach and flows out into the plains. By the river is written "Ebon", and on the plains, "Sonder".

    Book: In the bottom corner of the two pages, a compass is drawn, and next to it, a title: "The Red Mountain Valley".

    A: Turn the page

        A: You turn over the thick parchment. This page is titled "The Lefally Road", and depicts a closer view of the forested valley. A road runs from the top of the page to the bottom, embellished with guiding landmarks.

        A: A paper insert is included. It appears to be a rough copy of this page, drawn more recently. On closer inspection, it includes a new path branching east from the road and into the trees.

        A: The eastern path ends in a depiction of a campfire, which has been circled. Two similar campfire drawings have been added along the main road, south of where the path diverges.

Kath: Why have you taken it out? Did you forget the instructions? The ritual site will be in a holy monastery along the road through the Red Mountain Valley.

Kath: Never mind that no one has even heard of this monastery. And it'll be little more than monster-infested ruins by now, if the rumors are true about the scroll's age. I've about had it with rituals and their strange prescriptions... But ach, orders are orders, so here we are.
