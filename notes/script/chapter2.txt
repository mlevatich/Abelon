CHAPTER 2: The City in Darkness

NOTES
*****

Kath can act as a narrator in the first half when Abelon doesn't talk much.

Discover: Who the hell sabotaged the gates and risked the monsters getting in
from the north and west? Find them and bring them to justice. Something to do
with the plot to kill the king? Is Jericho behind it?

Following the various leads of this investigation is the central activity of
Chapter 1. You consult adults in all districts (receiving sidequests from them
in the process), knights in the barracks, Gaheris, Mona, a school instructor,
the watchers, etc. The mystery leads you to this truth:

Turns out it's just a group of kids behind it, who got the idea from their
parents to sabotage the city after the killing of the cardinal. Luci knows these
kids, says they're worthless and to kill them. Kath says that's overly harsh
and Luci learned it from Abelon. The kids put up a fight when you crash their
hideout. Injuring any of them ends the fight, as does killing one (Abelon
one-shots them, kath doesn't). Kath will hate you if you kill one, but Abelon
and Luci will respect the decision.

The kids' parents are Hellshuns. So is Mona? Basically Hellshuns don't believe
that you go to hell after you die, you go to heaven. Because life is so hard,
at the onset of the Despair the Cardinal (though it pained her) started
preaching that everyone goes to hell, to encourage people to fight through the
hard times and not give up. Older folks who remember the old doctrine sometimes
reject this belief and instead continue believing in heaven - they are
Hellshuns. They are viewed as dangerous people these days, because they may
kill themselves or others in order to "save" people from life's suffering and
bring them to heaven. It's acknowledged that most Hellshuns don't actually
think like this, of course, but it DID happen once in the past, and everyone
has been on edge since then. So in the investigation, the Hellshuns are the
first suspects of the knights for the gate sabotage. This leads them to Mona,
but this is ultimately a red herring. In the end, the culprits are the parents
of the children, who were just talking about things abstractly in the aftermath
of the cardinal's death. The children, overhearing, foolishly took matters into
their own hands and sabotaged the gate.

There's a plot to kill the king afoot. You can't outright find out about it, but
you can discover hints which only make sense after hearing the full story later.

The early choices involve the fishermen catching corrupted fish, Luci and
Gaheris's research, the Order of Watchers hating you, and Kath and the King.

Abelon doesn't appreciate you working with the Watchers or the Fisherman, or
sparing the thieves. These are not things he would do, and others comment on it.
Abelon likes you if you help Sinclair, work with Kath, hang out in the barracks,
and focus on killing monsters and protecting the city.

Jericho is the royal tactician, a smart and ruthless commander who is
nevertheless consumed with guilt at the costs of victory. He was appointed at
the beginning of the Despair due to the need to escape encounters with fewer
casualties. In chapter 2 we learn that he defended the west gate from attacking
wolves and ghouls, and made a desperation play to bring down part of the
ramparts on top of the enemy, killing some of the knights in order to win the
day. He feels guilty about this, but everyone knows it was the only way to win.

Mona is around. Perhaps she's with the watchers? She's looking for her daughter.

Shanti hates Jericho for getting her brother Jonathan killed. She is filled with
anger and unwilling to compromise, but is skilled and intelligent. She's one of
Abelon's knights.

Lester, a young prankster knight, acts like a sibling to Luci orphaned in the
barracks, and has a big heart for others, but is careless with regard to his
own safety. He's one of Kath's knights. He's a Hellshun.

If you saved Elaine and told her about the deer, she teaches her younger
sister to hunt and decides to join the knights. She is kind but inexperienced,
emotion-driven, and afraid of combat.

Luci acts as a red herring for Mona's daughter in chapters 2 and 3.

Late in the chapter, you decide who to bring with you, between Shanti, Lester
(if he's alive), and Elaine (if she's alive).

Learn: Abelon is the oldest and most experienced commander, which is why the
others take orders from you.

Learn: Some of the archives were moved to the castle library after the dragon
attack.

Learn: What did Abelon do? (he executed the Cardinal)

Other citizens in the capital:
The blacksmith
The shopkeeps
The tailor
The castle chef
The servants
The thieves
The orphans (children under the care of the knights at the barracks, until
someone else is willing to take them in)
The healer (Sinclair's brother – a greedy fool who overcharges his patients)
The knights
The gatekeepers (they have a grim responsibility – to communicate a warning of
monster attack at all costs)
The Order of Watchers (a secretive organization)
The fishermen (they've been pulling some strange corruption...)
