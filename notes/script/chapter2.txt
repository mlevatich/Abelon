CHAPTER 2: Sabotage in the Black City
*************************************

NOTES
*****

Kath can act as a narrator in the first half when Abelon doesn't talk much.

Discover: Who the hell sabotaged the bridges and risked the monsters getting in
from the north and west? Find them and bring them to justice. Something to do
with the plot to kill the king? Is Jericho behind it?

The chapter starts as it's mid-morning, and you enter the city. You and Kath
have an audience with the King later in the day, which will trigger by Kath
approaching you once you've talked to enough people in the city. When you talk
to the king, the conversation will change based on what exactly you learned.

Following the various leads of this investigation is the central activity of
Chapter 1. You consult adults in all districts (receiving sidequests from them
in the process), knights in the barracks (the gatekeepers), Gaheris, Mona, a
school instructor, the watchers, etc. The mystery leads you to this truth:

Regarding the sabotage case, the reason Elaine was in the forest was to hunt,
and she crossed the unguarded drawbridge on the mistaken assumption that it
was left open for her by the absent gatekeeper, with whom she is romantically
involved. The absent gatekeeper is missing for most of the chapter, since he
was incapacitated somehow by the perpetrators, but you can talk to the boy who
was on shift and went looking for him. All three of them (Elaine and the two
gatekeeper boys) are good friends. The remaining gatekeeper is concerned for
his missing friend, and reveals that his friend specifically requested to have
the early morning shift, a swap. This is a mystery unless Elaine is around to
reveal her hunting arrangement - her boyfriend lowers the bridge for her some
early mornings so she can enter the forest and hunt game for her little sister's
birthday. It is largely the only place to do so. This shocks the party, since
the north forest is so dangerous - if Elaine makes regular trips there, how is
it that she hasn't died? This is due to the talisman she wears, which is its own
mystery. A talisman which repels monsters? And why was it missing / broken when
she was last in the forest? Hmm.

Turns out it's just a group of kids behind it, who got the idea from their
parents to sabotage the city after the killing of the Cardinal. Luci knows these
kids, says they're worthless and to kill them. Kath says that's overly harsh
and Luci learned it from Abelon. The kids put up a fight when you crash their
hideout. Injuring any of them ends the fight, as does killing one (Abelon
one-shots them, kath doesn't). Kath will hate you if you kill one, but Abelon
and Luci will respect the decision.

The kids' parents are Hellshuns. So is Mona? Basically Hellshuns don't believe
that you go to hell after you die, you go to heaven. Because life is so hard,
at the onset of the Despair the Cardinal (though it pained her) started
preaching that everyone goes to hell, to encourage people to fight through the
hard times and not give up. Older folks who remember the old doctrine sometimes
reject this belief and instead continue believing in heaven - they are
Hellshuns. They are viewed as dangerous people these days, because they may
kill themselves or others in order to "save" people from life's suffering and
bring them to heaven. It's acknowledged that most Hellshuns don't actually
think like this, of course, but it DID happen once in the past, and everyone
has been on edge since then. So in the investigation, the Hellshuns are the
first suspects of the knights for the gate sabotage. This leads them to Mona,
but this is ultimately a red herring. In the end, the culprits are the parents
of the children, who were just talking about things abstractly in the aftermath
of the cardinal's death. The children, overhearing, foolishly took matters into
their own hands and sabotaged the gate.

There's a plot to kill the king afoot. You can't outright find out about it, but
you can discover hints which only make sense after hearing the full story later.

Abelon must inform the dead knight's family of her death. A service is held.
The palpable absence of the Cardinal, and the recent disbanding of the
Watchers, the primary religious organization in Ebonach, makes the organization
of the service rather awkward. Lester is your contact for this if he's alive,
otherwise it's Kath, who is mourning Lester. This leads into more information
about the Watchers and Hellshuns, and a potential lead for the sabotage case.

Gaheris is stuck between doing research and helping students and knights in
training to understand ignea. He resents this additional work that takes him
away from his research. When you first speak with him, he's grading exams. He's
quite fond of the student Luci, who has started working with him as a research
assistant, on top of being a knight-in-training. She's extremely bright, a
prodigy. You come to him initially to tell him about the weird new stone
monsters, but this conversation starts one of your leads in the sabotage
mystery.

You can discuss the sabotage work with the craftsmen. It is rather shoddy. You
can also discuss defense mechanisms, since they suggest one which is closed by
default, rather than open (like a drawbridge). Learn more about the Southwall
project.

The fishermen at the docks are finding bits of ignea in the fish they catch,
which is obviously a problem when it comes to feeding people. Somewhat humorous.
Can you eat ignea?

Food in Ebonach comes from farmland to the south that must be defended from
monsters constantly as a huge wall called the Southwall is under construction
around the land. This is where most of the knights' energy is spent. Food also
comes from fish in the sea to the east. To the north is a forest containing the
old path to Lefellen, but the forest is long since overrun and nobody goes
there these days. To the west is the Sonder, a rugged open plain between
Ebonach and Mistram.

Jericho is the royal tactician, a smart and ruthless commander who is
nevertheless consumed with guilt at the costs of victory. He was appointed at
the beginning of the Despair due to the need to escape encounters with fewer
casualties. In chapter 2 we learn that he defended the west gate from attacking
wolves, and made a desperation play to bring down part of the ramparts on top
of the enemy, killing some of the knights in order to win the day. He feels
guilty about this, but everyone knows it was the only way to win.

Mona is around. She is nominally in Ebonach to participate in a nature service
held by the Watchers, which is canceled, but she also longs for her daughter
and husband who were both killed in Lefellen. She yearns to find some trace of
them in the city.

Shanti is a skilled and intelligent mage of about 40. She's one of Abelon's
knights.

Lester, a prankster knight, acts like a sibling to Luci orphaned in the
barracks, and has a big heart for others, but is careless with regard to his
own safety. He's one of Kath's knights, and also Kath's best friend. He's a
Hellshun.

If you saved Elaine, there is an optional quest line for her to join the
knights. She is kind but inexperienced, emotion-driven, and afraid of combat.
You will also investigate her and her family as part of the sabotage mystery,
whether she is alive or dead.

Luci acts as a red herring for Mona's daughter in chapters 2 and 3. She is
incredibly talented as a student but cold and ruthless, which she picked up
from Abelon. She knows something about the sabotage case.

Late in the chapter, you decide who to bring with you, between Shanti, Lester,
and Elaine.

Slowly learn during chapter 2 that Abelon executed the Cardinal just a day ago
on the orders of King Sinclair, and formally disbanded the Order of the
Watchers, causing mass confusion.

To close out the chapter, the king sends you on a mission to Mistram, along
with a caravan of food. Mona joins you, seeking safe passage to her home in
Mistram. Luci sneaks aboard the convoy. You are permitted to bring a knight
along, either Shanti, Lester, or Elaine.

Other citizens in the capital:
The blacksmith
The shopkeeps
The tailor
The castle chef
The servants
The thieves
The orphans (children under the care of the knights at the barracks, until
someone else is willing to take them in)
The doctor
The other knights
The gatekeepers
