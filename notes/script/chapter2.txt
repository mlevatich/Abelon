CHAPTER 2: The City in Darkness
*******************************



*****
NOTES
*****

Kath can act as a narrator in the first half when Abelon doesn't talk much.

In castle town there's a gang of thieves â€“ good for a fight, but don't kill them!

Either reconcile with the Order of Watchers or fight with them in Chapter 1. Fighting is a fail state.

The early choices involve the fishermen catching corrupted fish, Luci and Gaheris's research,
the Order of Watchers hating you, and Kath and the King.

Abelon doesn't appreciate you working with the Watchers or the Fisherman, or sparing the thieves.
These are not things he would do, and others comment on it. Abelon likes you if you help Sinclair, work with Kath,
hang out in the barracks, and focus on killing monsters and protecting the city.

A strange encounter with the King's spies

Learn: Abelon is the oldest and most experienced commander, which is why the others take orders from you.

Learn: Some of the archives were moved to the castle library after the dragon attack.

Learn: What did Abelon do? (he executed the Cardinal)
