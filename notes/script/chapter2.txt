CHAPTER 2: The City in Darkness

NOTES
*****

Kath can act as a narrator in the first half when Abelon doesn't talk much.

In castle town there's a gang of thieves – good for a fight, but don't kill them!

Discover: Who the hell sabotaged the gates and risked the monsters getting in
from the north and west? Find them and bring them to justice. Something to do
with the plot to kill the king? Is Jericho behind it?

Either reconcile with the Order of Watchers or fight with them in Chapter 1. Fighting is a fail state.

The early choices involve the fishermen catching corrupted fish, Luci and Gaheris's research,
the Order of Watchers hating you, and Kath and the King.

Abelon doesn't appreciate you working with the Watchers or the Fisherman, or sparing the thieves.
These are not things he would do, and others comment on it. Abelon likes you if you help Sinclair, work with Kath,
hang out in the barracks, and focus on killing monsters and protecting the city.

Jericho is the royal tactician, a smart and ruthless commander who is nevertheless consumed with guilt at the costs
of victory. He was appointed at the beginning of the Despair due to the need to escape encounters with fewer casualties.
In chapter 2 we learn that he defended the west gate from attacking wolves and ghouls, and made a desperation play to
bring down part of the ramparts on top of the enemy, killing some of the knights in order to win the day. He feels guilty
about this, but everyone knows it was the only way to win.

Mona is around. Perhaps she's with the watchers? She's looking for her daughter.

Shanti hates Jericho for getting her brother Jonathan killed. She is filled with anger and unwilling to compromise, but
is skilled and intelligent.

Lester, a young prankster knight, acts like a sibling to Luci orphaned in the barracks, and has a big heart for others,
but is careless with regard to his own safety.

If you saved Elaine and told her about the deer, she teaches her younger sister to hunt and decides to join the knights.
She is kind but inexperienced, emotion-driven, and afraid of combat.

Luci acts as a red herring for Mona's daughter in chapters 2 and 3.

Late in the chapter, you decide who to bring with you, between Shanti, Lester (if he's alive), and Elaine (if she's alive).

Learn: Abelon is the oldest and most experienced commander, which is why the others take orders from you.

Learn: Some of the archives were moved to the castle library after the dragon attack.

Learn: What did Abelon do? (he executed the Cardinal)

Other citizens in the capital:
The blacksmith
The shopkeeps
The tailor
The castle chef
The servants
The thieves
The orphans (children under the care of the knights at the barracks, until someone else is willing to take them in)
The healer (Sinclair's brother – a greedy fool who overcharges his patients)
The knights
The gatekeepers (they have a grim responsibility – to communicate a warning of monster attack at all costs)
The Order of Watchers (a secretive organization)
The fishermen (they've been pulling some strange corruption...)
