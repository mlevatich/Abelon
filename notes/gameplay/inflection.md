# Inflection points

## Mechanics

In part 2, reach an “inflection point” with each character where abelon’s decision affects the epilogue. If the player has done right by the character, abelon will pick the positive choice. If the player has neglected the character, abelon will pick the negative choice. If in between, abelon will hesitate and the player may choose.

Specific mechanics:

- Dialogue choices / optional talk segments worth 1 impression
- First optional objective (small gameplay benefit) worth 0.5 impression
- Seciond optional objective (no gameplay benefit) worth 1 impression
- A choice on the inflection point requires 1.75 total impression
- Abelon making the choice requires 2.25 total impression

Dialogue which result in negative impressions throughout the story should present gameplay advantages (what abelon wouldve done - the “optimal” choice for survival). Therefore, succeeding the inflection point requires completing their second, larger optional obective as well as being very nice to the character if missing their small optional objective or opting for gameplay benefits from dialogue choices. Or just somewhat nice to the character if completing all of their optional objectives. For Abelon to be confident in making the choice, player must complete all optional objectives and be very nice.

## Instances

Kath’s inflection point is in the rubble in 2-1, he asks if Abelon thinks they’re friends (after abelon asks first). If they are, Kath will visit abelon the caretaker in the epilogue.

Lester’s inflection is after he runs away, when Kath asks Abelon if he regrets killing Lester's mother. If Abelon says no, Lester states his intention to kill Abelon after the events of the game. He is ultimately executed for his failed attempt. If Abelon says yes and that he wouldn't do it again, they start the path towards reconciliation.

Elaine's inflection is when asks if she was a burden and advocates continuing on to 2-7, after her attempted hero play late in the game. She becomes a paragon knight in the epilogue if Abelon assents.

Shanti's inflection is when she insists to Abelon that the truth is worth pursuing for its own sake, after requesting that she pursue an optional objective to retrieve a final lore puzzle piece which requires tons of agility to reach. If Abelon says yes, she visits in the epilogue.
