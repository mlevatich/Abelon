Every character has three skill "paths" to choose from, named by nouns (e.g. Abelon has Hero, Demon, and Executioner),
with an associated icon and color.

A skill in path X grants a point in path X, but may require a threshold of points from paths X Y or Z.

Everyone will be about level 12 by the end of the game, and each level grants a skill.

Characters are recruited at some level appropriate to where they arrive in the game, and get some number of starting
skills and corresponding points. Essentially, they already have some skills "unlocked". However, the number of skills
they start with may not be equal to their starting level â€“ every character, at recruitment, only has 5 or so spells so
as not to overwhelm the player, even if they start at level 9. Abelon will have 10-12 skills at the end of the game,
while other characters will have fewer (Gaheris might have only 6-7).

The skill requirements should be designed such that a) there are enough choices with each level up (3 or 4 seems
like a good number), b) a character will possess about half of their total unlockable skills by the end of the game,
and c) by the end of the game, a character will still not even meet the requirements for a good number of skills
(i.e. at least some skills have specific high requirements and need heavy investment).

Skills with higher requirements should generally cost more cobalt and ignea and have higher cooldowns, but should be
much more (situationally!) powerful, and indicate an extreme specialization in the particular path (i.e. the "top" of
Kath's Defender tree should have an expensive Forbearance-esque skill, and the "top" of Abelon's Executioner tree
could have an instant death ability that costs Abelon some stats or health). Skills with high cross-path requirements
should also be incredibly powerful, and feel very unique.

Low requirement skills should be low-cost, low-cooldown, bread and butter abilities like basic attacks, set-ups, and
movement abilities that open lots of strategic options without themselves doing much.
