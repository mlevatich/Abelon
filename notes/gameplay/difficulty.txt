On Normal difficulty, battles are designed to be beatable with fair ignea and cobalt usage and decent strategy,
without necessarily exploring the map. Map goodies will make the battles easier and allow for more mistakes.

On Adept difficulty, battles are beatable with excellent strategy and significant resource usage, requiring the player
to explore the map thoroughly in order to have enough resources to win all of the battles.

On Master difficulty, there is no save scumming, only a quicksave, and a single loss in battle deletes the save file.

Difficulty can be lowered but not raised.
