TODO list

#19: Augment scene engine with options like walking, events like
rumbling, blocking or non-blocking sequences, screen panning, etc.

#31: Make quest state into chapter state, a table keyed by state strings, not a
letter. Fix chapter instance variables and methods accordingly. Make following
a quest-line coherent, try to avoid blowup. Test on simple dialogue-based quest.

Cinematic triggers

#27: Support complex results, like costume changes, item gets,
chapter state changes, ability gets, new cinematic triggers, shopping menu,
etc.

#17: Inventory:
-design menu flowchart v1
-hover descriptions to menu items
-let hover descriptions combine graphics and text
-actions that either say you can't use, or close the menu and do some action
-deal with right-side menu overflow

#18: Shopping

#40: Presentation system â€“ present items/people to others in order to trigger
either fail states or quest advances

That's the core interaction engine done, then time for COMBAT
