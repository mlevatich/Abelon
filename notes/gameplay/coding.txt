What to do next, organized into sections and issues! (please commit each
paragraph separately for your own sanity)

SECTION: GAME ENTRY-EXIT PROCEDURES

Keep music and volume settings on hitting chapter/battle restart

Learning a skill doesn't pull you out of the inventory.

Settings: add turn auto-end

Battle begin menu: add party to this menu, so that skills are learnable

Quitting the game without saving mid-battle and restarting should return the
player to the BEGINNING of the battle, not to their last mid-battle save

#16:

Title screen v0 (continue (if save file detected), new game ->
choose difficulty)

Implement game start scene, implement ??? for sprites whose names are not known
to the player. Learning a name is a scene event.

#48:

Game guide shows up immediately on starting new game, and accessible from
inventory

Combat guide accessible from battle begin menu or options.

Post battle levelup / skilltree guide should show up after the first battle

#59:

Chapter end trigger. Displays a chapter 1 endcard, bridge scene, and chapter 2
start card (Teaser). Kicks you back to the title screen





SECTION: COMBAT ENGINE EXTENSIONS

#61:

improve AI algorithm - use other plans! In particular, enemies shouldn't
interfere with each other. If one enemy has only a single path to attack their
target, the acting enemy shouldn't get in the way of that path unless it
needs to in order to attack its own target. To minimize interference in general,
the strongest enemies should take their turns first, and the enemies who start
farther away from the allies should also be prioritized.

#69:

Add elaine sprite

Discover Elaine if you head north.

Finding Elaine should be a battle. Race a wolf to get to her! Not only is it
a race, the wolf only targets her. Kath can get in the way, but Abelon is further
behind, and you need to kill it before it gets to Elaine.

Elaine is an ally unit for the purposes of the battle, but has status debuffs
that make her unable to move, attack, or assist

Once she's saved and the battle is over, find her the right medicine to heal her,
and she'll join the party!





SECTION: MAP WORK

#57:

Fix screen tearing - each map has a background color instead of black that
blends in well with the tiles.

Split forest into three maps (west, south, north) with slightly different
tilesets/lighting/coloring

And flowers, logs, plants and such to forest

Redo forest tileset to use 2x2 trees

#9:

Expand lighting engine. Flickering, smoothing, obstacle detection, proper color
computation.

Add point lights to the forest to test: blocking, animated, torch-in-ground
sprite, facing either left or right.





SECTION: ANIMATION WORK

#52:

Every skill has an associated single-fire animation, with render position
determined by the cursor location of the cast. This has nothing to do with the
sprite casting the skill. For some skills, the animation should play at every
affected tile, for others, the animation should play centered on the cursor and
affected by direction. This should be provided as an option.

Insert appropriate hooks for skill animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Skill animations for all basic skills.

When sprites take damage, a damage splash should be rendered. When they heal,
a heal splash should be rendered. This should happen as the damage is dealt.
The idea of a "splash" animation could be re-used for skill animations.

When sprites gain exp, render exp splash. This should happen on a delay, so
the exp splash renders after the relevant action has just finished playing out.

#51:

Abelon-idle
Kath-idle
Elaine-idle

Kath-walk
Elaine-walk

Abelon-combat
Kath-combat
Elaine-combat

Abelon-combat-run
Kath-combat-run
Elaine-combat-run

Two mostly identical wolf sprites.

Wolf-combat (this doubles as Wolf-idle)
Wolf-walk (this doubles as Wolf-combat-run)

#53:

Each sprite that battles has seven single-fire animations: one for weapon
skills, one for spells, one for assists, one for being injured, one for dying,
one for combat entry (bridges idle -> combat), and one for combat exit (this
can just be the combat entry animation played in reverse). For hostile entities,
their combat entry and exit are just their idle animations, because their idle
animation is their combat animation. Hostile entities also have no assist
animation, and in some cases, no spell animation (e.g. for wolves)

Insert appropriate hooks for combat animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Abelon-combat-entry-exit
Abelon-weapon
Abelon-spell
Abelon-assist
Abelon-hurt
Abelon-death

Kath-combat-entry-exit
Kath-weapon
Kath-spell
Kath-assist
Kath-hurt
Kath-death

Elaine-combat-entry-exit
Elaine-weapon
Elaine-spell
Elaine-assist
Elaine-hurt
Elaine-death

Wolf-weapon
Wolf-hurt
Wolf-death





SECTION: SFX WORK

#4:

SFX for:
menu select (not too different from current)
Scene text sound effects
start game (from title screen)

#56:

SFX for:
use weapon skill
use spell
use assist
battle cursor move
battle select ally/enemy
battle select target for move/attack/assist
battle confirm end action
battle enemy turn start
battle ally turn start
level up
all skills

Mute ally turn start, enemy turn start, victory, defeat menus





SECTION: MUSIC TRACKS

#63:

For title screen music, use the voice memo on my phone: Time Slows. Tentative
track name: The Lonely Knight. Experiment with slow crescendos!

#64:

Defeat theme: Despair - Short theme that plays during the battle loss scene.

#65:

Enemy approaches theme - for rising action before a fight! This should play for
most of the forest.

#66:

Second battle theme - for the three non-boss encounters (or the boss encounter
if it's more epic than the first theme)

#67:

Better forest theme - more tense investigation, less funeral march





SECTION: CHAPTER 1 IMPLEMENTATION

#68:

Finish script - Do this before even looking at the below scenarios! Because
I might decide I want something different as I write the script.

#70:

implement Ghoul scenario (objective is rout or escape)

#71:

implement Deer scenario

#72:

Implement crystal wolf scenario (objective is rout and defend)

#73:

Make executable

#74:

Pre-alpha closed release
