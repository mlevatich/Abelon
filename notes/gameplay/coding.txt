TODO list

Panning: Chapter checks the current scene state when figuring out camera actions.
Camera should pan to and center on speaking sprite if the option is provided to
say(), otherwise centers on Abelon by default. Pan() is also a scene event which
causes the screen to pan to a provided coordinate until unPan() is called, at
which point the screen pans back to Abelon.

blocking and non-blocking rumble

fade transition: always blocking

Separate from behaviors and animations, player has "controls". Being in scene
is a set of controls, not a behavior. That way a player can be walking and
still have scene controls.

Have player follow a walking sprite to a destination nearby, by issuing a walk
for the sprite, a short wait, and a walk for Abelon

#31: Make quest state into chapter state, a table keyed by state strings, not a
letter. Fix chapter instance variables and methods accordingly. Make following
a quest-line coherent, try to avoid blowup. Test on simple dialogue-based quest.

Cinematic triggers

#27: Support complex results, like costume changes, item gets,
chapter state changes, ability gets, new cinematic triggers, shopping menu,
etc.

#17: Inventory:
-design menu flowchart v1
-hover descriptions to menu items
-let hover descriptions combine graphics and text
-actions that either say you can't use, or close the menu and do some action
-deal with right-side menu overflow

#18: Shopping

#40: Presentation system â€“ present items/people to others in order to trigger
either fail states or quest advances

That's the core interaction engine done, then time for COMBAT
