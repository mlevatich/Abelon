TODO list

Item is not a class, just use sprite and have Triggers.lua contain the list of
use triggers. So Items.lua can be deleted. Sprite file contains presenttriggers
(which is just a list of characters that it can be presented to), description,
and discardability. Hover box for items is always the same for each item.
Sprite.lua can have a toItem and toPartyMember method.

SKILLS however, will probably need their own class.
