(please commit each paragraph separately for your own sanity)

#50:

Enemy AI algorithm

Bug: abelon changing direction briefly during a pathed walk, in between two
walkTo behaviors

Implement stun, enrage

#55:

exp gain formulas: 1 per damage dealt, 0.5 per damage taken, 1 per damage
healed, 0.5 of the value for assisters supporting any of these, flat amount for
buffs and debuffs that land.

level up table: exp required for a level up increases with level

level up (+1 to all attributes, choice of extra attribute +1, +1 skill point)

#4:

Write sound effects engine, globally available.

Basic beep and boop sfx for all interactions (basically whenever F or D is
pressed and does something).

Scene text sound effects

#56:

Sound effect for: weapon skill, spell, assist, death, victory.

#52:

Every skill has an associated single-fire animation, with render position
determined by the cursor location of the cast. This has nothing to do with the
sprite casting the skill. For some skills, the animation should play at every
affected tile, for others, the animation should play centered on the cursor.
This should be provided as an option.

Insert appropriate hooks for skill animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Skill animations for all basic skills.

Sound effects for all skills.

#16:

Title screen v0 (continue (if save file detected), new game ->
choose difficulty)

Implement game start scene, implement ??? for sprites whose names are not known
to the player. Learning a name is a scene event.

For title screen music, use the voice memo on my phone: Time Slows. Tentative
track name: The Lonely Knight

#15:

Refactor parsing, move to parsing utils file. Files should be parsed
automatically into a dict, like JSON

Save state (rewrite sprite files to savedata, pull from there first if it
exists unless new game)

#28:

Attempt to autosave on game quit. Autosave after every scene, every battle
action, and every map transition. Implement restart chapter, restart battle,
and battle game over.

#51:

Abelon-idle
Kath-idle

Kath-walk

Abelon-combat
Kath-combat

Abelon-combat-run
Kath-combat-run

Two mostly identical wolf sprites.

Wolf-combat (this doubles as Wolf-idle)
Wolf-walk (this doubles as Wolf-combat-run)

#53:

Each sprite that battles has seven single-fire animations: one for weapon
skills, one for spells, one for assists, one for being injured, one for dying,
one for combat entry (bridges idle -> combat), and one for combat exit (this
can just be the combat entry animation played in reverse). For hostile entities,
their combat entry and exit are just their idle animations, because their idle
animation is their combat animation. Hostile entities also have no assist
animation, and in some cases, no spell animation (e.g. for wolves)

Insert appropriate hooks for combat animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Abelon-combat-entry-exit
Abelon-weapon
Abelon-spell
Abelon-assist
Abelon-hurt
Abelon-death

Kath-combat-entry-exit
Kath-weapon
Kath-spell
Kath-assist
Kath-hurt
Kath-death

Wolf-weapon
Wolf-hurt
Wolf-death

NEW ISSUE: combat QoL

Try to minimize the amount of text. Replace text with pictures as much as
possible?

The effect of an attack on whatever targets will be hit should be rendered in
the top right. Instead of the normal hover overlay, render rows starting from
the top right of the screen, where each row is two hover overlays: the before
-> after of the sprite's status and assists. Max this out by line number so
there's no overflow.

The effect of an assist on the squares that it will activate should be rendered
in the top right. See above.

When sprites take damage, a damage splash should be rendered. When they heal,
a heal splash should be rendered. While a sprite's action is playing out, what
they're doing should render in the top right. Just the ability name and icons.

When sprites gain exp, render exp splash.

For free aim, the cursor can be on any space given by the FREE_AIM field
(intersect a diamond of size "scale" with the targets given by "target").
FREE_AIM moves should render an outline of the move's range

#57:

Split forest into three maps (west, south, north) with slightly different
tilesets/lighting/coloring

And flowers, logs, plants and such to forest

Redo forest tileset to use 2x2 trees

Fix screen tearing - each map has a background color instead of black that
blends in well with the tiles.

#9:

Expand lighting engine

Add point lights to the forest to test

#48:

Game guide shows up immediately on starting new game, and accessible from
inventory

Combat guide accessible from battle begin menu or options, both of these
replace "formulas".

#18:

Shopping and gold

#33:

Big refactor!





FUTURE: Most of these are not issues yet, but they will be once the above are
done. They should all be individual issues.

Finish script - Do this before even looking at the below scenarios! Because
I might decide I want something different as I write the script.
Better forest theme - more tense investigation, less funeral march
Basic battle theme - for the three non-boss encounters
Enemy approaches theme - for rising action before a fight! This should play for
most of the forest.
Defeat theme: Despair - Short theme that plays during the battle loss scene.
implement Elaine scenario
implement Ghoul scenario (objective is rout or escape)
implement Deer scenario
Implement crystal wolf scenario (objective is rout and defend)
Chapter 1 endcard, end scene teaser
Make executable
Become the knight Abelon and take on the world
