assists take affect when a character stops their movement. So they can benefit
from two assists if they move into an assist, attack, and then move into a
different assist (if an assist has a one-time effect, such as a heal, it can
only proc once for the same character).

When aiming an attack, there are two indicators: the (colored) cursor, and the
light colored filled-squares zone indicator. The zone is given by the AOE shape,
where the center of the shape table is the cursor location.
For directional attacks, the cursor is always pointing in a direction away from
the caster. For self casts, the cursor is always on the caster. For free aim
the cursor can be on any space given by the FREE_AIM field (intersect a diamond
of size "scale" with the targets given by "target").
For attacks and spells, the zone and cursor are red. For assists, the zone and
cursor are green.

exp gain formulas: 1 per damage dealt, 0.5 per damage taken, 1 per damage
healed, 0.5 of the value for assisters supporting any of these
level up (+1 to all attributes, choice of extra attribute +1)

v1 skill trees for abelon and kath (change abelon's "champion" to "veteran")
inspire: aoe long range assist for abelon
trust: abelon triples his affinity for the turn
pinpoint: find a weak spot. Very specific range required.
assassinate: if pinpoint was used last turn, and you have at least 3 assists,
ability instantly kills target. Otherwise it does nothing.
judgement: abelon instantly kills an enemy anywhere on the map with 10% less HP
crucible: abelon deals (insanely high damage) in a huge area around him, including
to himself and allies. The ability cannot kill abelon
forbearance: kath assist, kath takes all damage meant for an adjacent target
guardian angel: an ally kath assists takes no damage until their next turn.
observe: once per battle, elaine selects an ally. At the end of the battle,
elaine will gain 1 attribute point in that ally's highest (non-endurance) stat.
(she starts off very weak to compensate)
hold the line: kath assist grants massive reaction to all allies in a line



Tune combat and difficulty levels around first battle until it is super fun.
