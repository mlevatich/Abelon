Portraits for all sprites

blocking / non-blocking sprites

merge dialogue and cinematics. Cinematic functionality is a superset of dialogues, no reason for them to be different
subsystems. Use lua files, not text files. Allow characters to stop, face one another on entering scene via config of
the lua file, not by default in the scene setup

Support more than two dialogue responses

Make quest state into chapter state, a table keyed by state strings, not a letter. Fix chapter instance variables and
methods accordingly.

Augment scene engine with quest state and options like walking, events like rumbling, blocking or non-blocking
sequences, etc. Support complex results, like costume changes, item gets, chapter state changes, ability gets, cinematic
triggers, etc.

Continue to draw assets, and make music, as necessary

#17:
-design menu flowchart v1
-hover descriptions to menu items
-let hover descriptions combine graphics and text
-actions that either say you can't use, or close the menu and do some action
-deal with right-side menu overflow
#13 -> #27 -> #31 -> #18
note: costume change is an interaction result

Shopping

Presentation system â€“ present items/people to others in order to trigger either fail states or quest advances

Core engine done! Implement chapter 1 minus the battles to exercise all of these features. Put scenes in place of
battles.
