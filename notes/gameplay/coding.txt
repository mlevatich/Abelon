Probably need lua functions, not text files, for complex interaction results and cinematic triggers.

Consider whether objects, people, and stickers are not all simply sprites with different levels of interactivity.
What is the best way to build an abstraction for all of these? Superclasses?

Presentation system â€“ present items/people to others in order to trigger either fail states or quest advances.

You can have more than two choices for dialogue responses.

Sprites can be blocking/non-blocking to allow you to pass through them.

Checkpoint system for save scumming. Make a maximum of two checkpoints. Quicksave (save file) doesn't count as a
checkpoint. Something to do with chapter barriers?
