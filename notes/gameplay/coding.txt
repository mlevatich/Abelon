#37:

In attack effects (not assists), targets turn to face sp

Assist green zone should persist after the action ends. The shade of green (but
not the alpha) should change depending on the number of assists active on a
square. Implement this as a temp view in the bottom of the stack

Assist and status effect implementation

Tapping a greyed out sprite gives an attribute menu

Hovering a green square should display all assist effects active on that square.
Same box as the sprite box. Hover overlay for a sprite should show status
effects on the sprite, and assists active.

The effect of an attack on whatever targets will be hit should be rendered in
the top right. Instead of the normal hover overlay, render rows starting from
the top right of the screen, where each row is two hover overlays: the before
-> after of the sprite's status and assists. Max this out by line number so
there's no overflow.

For free aim, the cursor can be on any space given by the FREE_AIM field
(intersect a diamond of size "scale" with the targets given by "target").
FREE_AIM moves should render an outline of the move's range

Add more skills: (change abelon's "champion" to "veteran")
inspire: aoe long range assist for abelon
trust: abelon triples his affinity for the turn
pinpoint: find a weak spot. Very specific range required.
assassinate: if pinpoint was used last turn, and you have at least 3 assists,
ability instantly kills target. Otherwise it does nothing.
crucible: abelon deals (insanely high damage) in a huge area around him,
including to himself. The ability cannot kill abelon.
forbearance: kath assist, kath takes all damage meant for an adjacent target
guardian angel: an ally kath assists takes no damage until their next turn.
observe: once per battle, elaine selects an ally. At the end of the battle,
elaine will gain 1 attribute point in that ally's highest (non-endurance) stat.
(she starts off very weak to compensate)
hold the line: kath assist grants massive reaction to all allies in a line
in shadow: passive ability - if no assists, enemies wont target you

#38:

When end turn is selected (or turn auto-ends when all allies go grey), enemy
phase starts, and ends instantly with all enemies doing nothing.

Support scene triggers during combat at: select unit for the first time on ally
phase, start new phase, end action. Triggers receive turn number, allies/enemies
and their statuses. Add the scenes from the chapter 1 script to the battle.

Win and loss conditions checked on: end action, start new phase. Win and loss
conditions accept allies/enemies and their locations, and turn number.

Winning ends the battle and returns control to player (likely after launching
a victory scene). Losing launches a defeat scene and then simply closes the game
(wait until #28 for game over).

#50:

enemy skill targeting info

movement range of allies and enemies takes obstacles into account (run
all-shortest-paths algorithm on the grid once, and store the result in a new
pathing grid)

Enemy AI: use targeting info to figure out which square to target. Move as close
as possible to that square (but no farther than necessary to use the attack)
by consulting the shortest paths grid. If in range to use attack, use it.

Movement triggers: enemies stay still until a trigger (like ally proximity, or
reinforcements arriving) activates them. Only then will they start moving and
acting.

#16:

Title screen v0 (continue (if save file detected), new game ->
choose difficulty)

Implement game start scene, implement ??? for sprites whose names are not known
to the player. Learning a name is a scene event.

#15:

Refactor parsing, move to parsing utils file. Files should be parsed
automatically into a dict, like JSON

Save state (rewrite sprite files to savedata, pull from there first if it
exists unless new game)

#28:

Autosave on game quit by ANY means (no rollbacks!), Autosave chapter start of
current chapter and battle start of current battle. Implement restart chapter,
restart battle, and battle game over options.

#55:

exp gain formulas: 1 per damage dealt, 0.5 per damage taken, 1 per damage
healed, 0.5 of the value for assisters supporting any of these

level up (+1 to all attributes, choice of extra attribute +1, +1 skill point)

#54:

Changing the difficulty level changes enemy attributes. Tune until it makes
sense.

#4:

Write sound effects engine, globally available.

Basic beep and boop sfx for all interactions (basically whenever F or D is
pressed and does something).

#51:

Abelon-idle
Kath-idle

Kath-walk

Abelon-combat
Kath-combat

Two mostly identical wolf sprites.

Wolf-combat (this doubles as Wolf-idle)

Wolf-walk

#52:

Implement single-fire animations in the animations engine. Simply
change animation and provide a done-action to the animation object that
changes their animation again once all frames are finished.

Every skill has an associated single-fire animation, with render position
determined by the cursor location of the cast. This has nothing to do with the
sprite casting the skill. For some skills, the animation should play at every
affected tile, for others, the animation should play centered on the cursor.
This should be provided as an option.

Insert appropriate hooks for skill animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Skill animations for all basic skills.

#53:

Each sprite that battles has seven single-fire animations: one for weapon
skills, one for spells, one for assists, one for being injured, one for dying,
one for combat entry (bridges idle -> combat), and one for combat exit (this
can just be the combat entry animation played in reverse). For hostile entities,
their combat entry and exit are just their idle animations, because their idle
animation is their combat animation. Hostile entities also have no assist
animation, and in some cases, no spell animation (e.g. for wolves)

Insert appropriate hooks for combat animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

#56:

Sound effect for: weapon skill, spell, assist, death, defeat, victory.

#57:

Split forest into three maps (west, south, north) with slightly different
tilesets/lighting/coloring

And flowers, logs, plants and such to forest

Redo forest tileset to use 2x2 trees

Fix screen tearing - each map has a background color instead of black that
blends in well with the tiles.

#9:

Expand lighting engine

Add point lights to the forest to test








FUTURE: Most of these are not issues yet, but they will be once the above are
done. They should all be individual issues.

Finish script - Do this before even looking at the below scenarios! Because
I might decide I want something different as I write the script.
Better forest theme - more tense investigation, less funeral march
Basic battle theme - for the three non-boss encounters
Enemy approaches theme - for rising action before a fight!
implement Elaine scenario
implement Ghoul scenario
implement Deer scenario
Implement crystal wolf scenario
