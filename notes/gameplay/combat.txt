Every turn, each character on the team does a move, action, rest of move (X
amount of movement points total), assist. The player may choose the order in
which the characters act.

Assist system: get attack and defense bonuses based on your position relative
to other allies. Assists affect a range of tiles like moves in chess. Could be
an assist to close characters, far away characters, diagonal characters,
characters in a straight line, characters around an enemy. etc.

Characters have weapon skills, spells, and assists, as well as passives (not
many passives though). Spells and assists may cost ignea. These four types of
abilities can be learned through a skill tree system. This, along with stats,
represent the bulk of the progression in the game.

Spells, and some assists, deplete ignea. Each character has their own store
of ignea, making it work much like mana in your average RPG.

Plan your whole turn to kill as many people as possible and leave yourself with
lots of defensive assists!

Maps are mostly mid-sized, but size varies. A battle should take about 30min.
Varied objectives to spice things up (escape, defend, kill target, kill all).
All maps have turn limits, and most have optional objectives - loot!

Performing actions grants EXP. EXP levels up characters, which grants a skill
point and some stat boosts. In addition to flat boosts, extra boost to a stat
can be chosen, a la superstar saga. The amount of EXP for each level up scales
upwards, and monsters give a flat amount of EXP, so lower leveled characters
can catch up. Leveling up is faster in the early game.

One reset turn ability per battle. No divine pulse. If any unit dies in battle,
the battle is lost. After a loss in battle, the player may choose to restart
the battle or restart the chapter.
