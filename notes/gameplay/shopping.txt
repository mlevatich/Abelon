In rest areas, before an expedition, the player is granted a fixed sum of money. This money is used to purchase
consumables for use on the expedition. Consumables might be abilities like grenades, cobalt or ignea restoratives,
stat boosts, or other limited use powers like the ability to reveal treasure or use an extra divine pulse. These
items may not all be purchased in one place but instead be scattered around the rest area, encouraging exploration
(e.g. a priest might bless Kath's shield, or a potion seller might whip up an attack-raising, defense-lowering brew).
Different consumables are available depending on the rest area.

Many rewards and shopping locations are unlocked by doing specific things in the rest area, which close out other
options. Some rewards are paid for, some are free if they are particularly challenging to find.
