    - XP: Shanti 65, Kath 110, Abelon 154, Elaine 87 (Total 416)
    - Ignea: 27 used (10 gained) (worth noting I fucked up at the end and wasted a lot of ignea. Build is fine.)
    - Difficulty: Very challenging
    - Inversion with an Abelon force build has amazing potential

    - XP: Shanti 132, Kath 139, Abelon 142, Elaine 149 (Total 562)

# Lester battle (1fb58476)

- Test 1 (Heal Lester, Abelon Affinity, Elaine Force, Kath Reaction):
    - XP: Abelon 197, Shanti 220, Kath 248, Elaine 256, Lester 100 (Total: 1021)
    - Ignea: 17 used
    - Difficulty: Moderate
    - Notes: High force Elaine does absurd damage. Volley and Piercing Shot plenty effective here. Farsight effective with Riposte, although maybe Farsight should be free? Riposte Kath does work here. Bleed Vitality probably needs a buff, it isn't that useful.

# Final battle (1fb58476)

- Test 1 (Abelon Affinity, Elaine Force, Kath Reaction):
    - Difficulty: Moderate
    - Notes: Last two terrors should spawn in the same scene Shanti brings the barrier down, and reinforcements from the north should appear at the same time. Allow an extra turn to fight the terror.

# Lester battle (ec451318)

- Test 1 (Abelon Endurance, Elaine Affinity, Kath Force, Shanti Force):
    - XP: Abelon 303, Shanti 264, Kath 222, Elaine 171, Lester 100 (Total: 1060)
    - Ignea: 13 used
    - Difficulty: Moderate
    - Notes: Used a lot of retribution and riposte. Even without a high force Elaine, still kind of easy. Basic combo of trust->blindspot->riposte->forbearance lets abelon and kath just kill everything. Maybe toss an Alpha wolf into the last two sets of reinforcements. Farsight will be needed to really get the most out of riposte.

# Final battle (ec451318)

- Test 1 (Abelon Endurance, Elaine Affinity, Kath Force, Shanti Force):
    - Difficulty: Very challenging
    - Notes: Changes made to spawns are good. Battle is going to be hard no matter what. I used poison coat to tank claws for the terror, although a retribution-based strategy to tank the full damage could be very cool. More feasible if you surround it and let it use eyes first, so that it gets the reduced movement. Gambit is very strong but I don't think it's overpowered. Found a good use-case for judgement, and seeking arrow is also extremely strong, worth the cost in many circumstances.
