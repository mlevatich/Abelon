On Normal difficulty, battles are designed to be beatable with fair resource usage and inefficient (but not brainless) strategy. All optional content and battle objectives may be ignored. Allies replenish 50% of their total Ignea after each battle. The pinnacle battle (2-7) is not available on Normal difficulty.

On Adept difficulty, battles are beatable with careful strategy and significant resource usage. Rewards from exploration, environmental puzzles, and optional objectives introduce a buffer that allows players to make mistakes or use more resources. Allies replenish 25% of their total Ignea after each battle. The pinnacle battle (2-7) raises the difficulty to what one would expect of a Master-difficulty battle, requiring excellent strategy from turn 1 and exhausting all resources available.

On Master difficulty, battles are beatable with excellent strategy and significant resource usage, requiring the player to explore thoroughly and complete most optional objectives in order to have enough resources to win all of the battles. No Ignea is replenished after each battle. The pinnacle battle (2-7) is beatable only with perfect strategy and deliberate character builds. Beating the pinnacle battle on Master difficulty is an achievement and awards something fancy on the game's title screen.

Difficulty can be lowered but not raised.
