On Normal difficulty, battles are designed to be beatable with fair resource usage and inefficient (but not brainless) strategy. Exploration and optional content can be ignored. Some resources are awarded after each battle. The pinnacle battle is not available on Normal difficulty.

On Adept difficulty, battles are beatable with careful strategy and significant resource usage. Rewards from exploration and optional content introduce a buffer that allows players to make mistakes or use more resources. The pinnacle battle raises the difficulty to what one would expect of a Master-difficulty battle, requiring excellent strategy from turn 1 and exhausting all resources available.

On Master difficulty, battles are beatable with excellent strategy and significant resource usage, requiring the player to explore thoroughly in order to have enough resources to win all of the battles. The pinnacle battle is beatable only with perfect strategy and deliberate character builds. Beating the pinnacle battle on Master difficulty is an achievement and awards something fancy on the game's title screen.

Difficulty can be lowered but not raised.
