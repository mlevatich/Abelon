# Setting, world-building, and story context

## Context and common knowledge

The world of Eruta is inhabited by humans and monsters. Monsters have always been antagonistic towards humans, but in the last century they have grown such in number and ferocity that humanity is strapped for resources and threatened with extinction, a condition referred to as the Despair. In Ebonach, the last city of the once-sprawling kingdom of Lefally, humanity fights valiantly against the ever-worsening threat.

Ebonach is nestled at the edge of the Red Mountain Valley which winds far to the northeast. South and west of the city lies an open plain, the Sonder. The rising peaks of the Red Mountains form a natural barrier to the east, and the River Ebon to the south similarly shields the city's farmland from monsters. The river runs down from the east mountains to the south of the city, before curving northwest, forming a huge impassable moat on the west edge of the city, which has one large bridge across it. The river continues west, out of the valley, where once were towns of Lefally. Northeast of Ebonach in the valley is a forest - the north wall of Ebonach is protected by a fortified wall and a “moat” of spike pits, with only a single small bridge allowing access to the forest. The river is shallower to the south by the farms, so monsters of the plains have started fording it, motivating the construction of the southwall along the river, to join with the main city entrance to the west, and the mountains to the east. Further northeast still, beyond the forest, are the ruins of Lefellen, the first city of the Kingdom, which was razed by a giant monster some twenty years ago.

Ebonach, now all that remains of the Kingdom, is led by King Sinclair, a controversial figure who rules with an iron fist and brooks no opposition. Many quietly seethe under his strict laws and frequent executions, while others credit his tough rule for keeping humanity alive in the trying times. Most of the citizens of Ebonach are employed as warriors in the King's army to fight off monster attacks, or as farmers in the fields or miners in the mountains, who extract food and Ignea from the land respectively. Ignea, the red, glowing dust and rock is nearly as valuable as fruit and wheat, as it powers the magical spells that soldiers use to fend off monsters of superior physical agility and bulk. Others in the city are craftsmen, builders, teachers, doctors, and artisans, while still fewer are entertainers, or statesmen.

After the King, the most powerful people in Ebonach are not these statesmen but the Knight Captains Abelon and Kath, uncommonly brilliant tactical minds who lead the army and are King Sinclair's closest advisors. Even more so than the King, Abelon is widely disliked, both for his severe demeanor and for being the King's executioner. Kath, meanwhile, enjoys adoration from the people for wearing a perpetual smile and always being ready with a kind word or deed.

With the Despair looming over the city, the King has decided to take a drastic course of action. He unseals a scroll of doom, a treasured artifact of the kingdom, and deciphers its contents. It contains preparatory steps and incantations necessary to summon and command what is supposedly an astonishingly powerful "Demon of Old". The King sends his captains Abelon and Kath, another accomplished knight Lester, and Ebonach's premier Ignaeic scholar Shanti on an expedition into the forest to the ritual site, which is in the ruins of a long-abandoned monastery. Abelon leads the group, which is ostensibly small in an attempt to avoid detection and not leave the city defenseless.

The four make their way into the forest towards the ruins of the monastery, with the hopes of humanity pinned on their success. After two days of bushwhacking through dense forest with no sign of monsters, they camp for the second night in a clearing near some stone reliefs which they believe to be old road markers for the monastery. Abelon offers to take the second watch.

## The true history

The world known to humans as Eruta is a living, slumbering being. In ancient history, long before any humans were alive to record it, Eruta was awake, and no life could survive on its heaving surface. Only after it fell into a deep sleep of many thousands of years could life, and eventually humanity, arise.

The blood of life that courses through Eruta under its surface is Ignea, a mineral of immense power. Over time, humans learned to harness this power; they used incantations to draw out the energy contained in stones of pure ignea, and they channeled that energy into "spells".

What humans know as "monsters" – corrupted animals and animate nature – are closer to an immune system for Eruta. They do not steal Eruta's bounties, but rather spring forth from the land to destroy humanity for harvesting Eruta's blood.

When the town of Lefellen in the Red Mountain Valley was just beginning to thrive, before the Kingdom of Lefally or Ebonach existed, the digging up of Ignea by humans so agitated Eruta's sleeping body that a giant monster, bigger than any seen before, rose from the earth to destroy the valley settlements. It arrived first at the Lefally Monastery in the forest a few days outside of town, where Ignea was regularly ignited and burned in worship of the goddess Eruta, and had thus collected in vast quantity. The monastery was obliterated.

A single monk, Gaheris, escaped the monastery, in hand a ritual scroll containing incantations he had developed to summon an otherworldly power, something the monk called the "Demon of Old". He rushed to Lefellen to warn the people.

Gaheris set out with Lefally's army, led by General Mona, to meet the monster near the monastery. Mona used the ritual scroll and summoned the Demon of Old, which took over her mind and possessed her. After a period of confusion, with the help of Gaheris, the two minds were reconciled.

With the help of the Demon of Old, Mona came to understand that the monster was Eruta's final warning. It was named the Messenger, and its "message" was from Eruta: "do not disturb me further, or else". Either the Messenger would succeeded in killing the humans where Eruta's common defenses had failed, or it would be slain by humans, indicating a grievous threat to Eruta and triggering its awakening and the subsequent near-instantaneous destruction of all life on its surface. Humanity was a fragile parasite on an incomprehensibly vast organism, and, it seems, stood no chance.

Because the Messenger aimed to destroy the human threat, and killing it was not an option, Mona had no choice but to pacify it on the advice of the Demon of Old. A great and peculiar battle over the ruins of the Monastery was fought to first subdue, and then befriend the strange, hulking monster. Most of the army perished, leaving only Mona, Gaheris, and three loyal soldiers remaining, but the Messenger was docile.

To keep the Messenger safe for all time, Mona, the noble general, agreed to become the Messenger's Caretaker. She entrusted the ritual scroll back to Gaheris and bid the soldiers farewell. She led the Messenger to a secluded cave underneath the monastery and had her soldiers collapse the entrance. The four returnees, who were sworn to secrecy, told the common citizens of Lefellen that the monster had been successfully slain, and that Mona had sacrificed her life to ensure victory. The Lefally Monastery was condemned as a cursed place, never to be visited.

The energy emitted by the Messenger afforded Mona, the ever-present Caretaker, with boundless vitality and shielded her body from decay as she watched over the quiet creature. The Demon of Old faded gradually from her mind.

The humans of the time did not understood the cause of the Messenger's arrival, and further assumed the problem to be behind them. Mining of Ignea continued apace, and the people of Lefellen founded a new city to the south called Ebonach, and joined the two settlements into the Kingdom of Lefally. The sealed ritual scroll, which Gaheris had before his death branded a scroll of doom containing no value, came to reside in Ebonach's royal palace as a mysterious artifact, treasured and feared, but mostly forgotten.

Hundreds of years passed. The people fought further expansionary wars into the western plains, mining more rock to fuel more spells for more battles. The Messenger, anguished by this great attack upon the land, broke free from the Caretaker and vanished. Shortly after the Kingdom's victory in the Plains war, their new western settlements were obliterated by hordes of monsters, including a giant beast for which they had no answer and whose name had long since been lost to history.

The Caretaker, unaware and unconcerned with the events of the outside world, simply assumed the Messenger to have passed away, and speculated that she soon would too. Feeling the weight of many centuries on her psyche and thinking her task complete, she remained in the sealed cave to mourn the loss of the Messenger, her truest friend.

Within the Kingdom, monster attacks grew more vicious, their arrival often heralded by rumored sightings of a giant beast. The people of Lefally lost contact with other kingdoms and gave ground to the monsters. In a final, terrible blow, the giant monster appeared again to raze Lefellen after the newly crowned King Sinclair began constructing new mines there. The humans retreated to Ebonach, their last bastion, and searched desperately for solutions.
