## Recent History and Common Knowledge

The world of Eruta is inhabited by humans and monsters. Monsters have always been antagonistic towards humans, but in the last century they have grown such in number and ferocity that humanity is strapped for resources and threatened with extinction, a condition referred to as the Despair. In Ebonach, the last city of the once-sprawling kingdom of Lefally, humanity fights valiantly against the ever-worsening threat.

Ebonach is nestled at the edge of the Red Mountain Valley which winds far to the northeast. South and west of the city lies an open plain, the Sonder. The rising peaks of the Red Mountains form a natural barrier to the east, and the River Ebon to the south similarly shields the city's farmland from monsters. The river runs down from the east mountains to the south of the city, before curving northwest, forming a huge impassable moat on the west edge of the city, which has one large bridge across it. The river continues west, out of the valley. Northeast of Ebonach in the valley is a forest - the north wall of Ebonach is protected by a fortified wall and a “moat” of spike pits, with only a single small bridge allowing access to the forest. The river is shallower to the south by the farms, so monsters of the plains have started fording it, motivating the construction of the southwall along the river, to join with the main city entrance to the west, and the mountains to the east.

Further northeast still, beyond the forest, are the ruins of Lefellen, the first city of the Kingdom, and the Kingdom Archives, which were both razed by a giant monster some twenty years ago.

Ebonach, now all that remains of the Kingdom, is led by King Sinclair, a controversial figure who rules with an iron fist and brooks no opposition. Many quietly seethe under his strict laws and frequent executions, while others credit his tough rule for keeping humanity alive in the trying times. Most of the citizens of Ebonach are employed as warriors in the King's army to fight off monster attacks, or as farmers in the fields or miners in the mountains, who extract food and Ignea from the land respectively. Ignea, the red, glowing dust and rock is nearly as valuable as fruit and wheat, as it powers the magical spells that soldiers use to fend off monsters of superior physical agility and bulk. Others in the city are craftsmen, builders, teachers, doctors, and artisans, while still fewer are entertainers, or statesmen.

After the King, the most powerful people in Ebonach are not these statesmen but the Knight Captains Abelon and Kath, uncommonly brilliant tactical minds who lead the army and are King Sinclair's closest advisors. Even more so than the King, Abelon is widely disliked, both for his severe demeanor and for being the King's executioner. Kath, meanwhile, enjoys adoration from the people for wearing a perpetual smile and always being ready with a kind word or deed.

With the Despair looming over the city, the King has decided to take a drastic course of action. A search party has returned from the ruins of Lefellen with an ancient ritual scroll, containing preparatory steps and incantations necessary to summon and command what is supposedly an astonishingly powerful "Demon of Old".Apocryphally, such a summoning foretells chaos and death, and only recently has King Sinclair grown desparate enough to attempt to find the scroll and use the demon to defend against monster attacks. The King sends both Abelon and Kath, another accomplished knight Lester, and Ebonach's premier Ignaeic scholar Shanti on an expedition north to the ritual site. Abelon leads the group, which is ostensibly small in an attempt to avoid detection and not leave the city defenseless.

The four make their way into the forest towards the ruins of Lefellen, with the hopes of humanity pinned on their success. But the expedition is not all it seems, and its consequences may change the course of history forever...

## The True History

The world known to humans as Eruta is a living, slumbering being. In ancient history, long before any humans were alive to record it, Eruta was awake, and no life could survive on its heaving surface. Only after it fell into a deep sleep of many thousands of years could life, and eventually humanity, arise.

The blood of life that courses through Eruta under its surface is Ignea, a mineral of immense power. Over time, humans learned to harness this power; they used incantations to draw out the energy contained in stones of pure ignea, and they channeled that energy into "spells".

What humans know as "monsters" – corrupted animals and animate nature – are closer to an immune system for Eruta. They do not steal Eruta's bounties, but rather spring forth from the land to destroy humanity for harvesting Eruta's blood.

When the town of Lefellen in the Red Mountain Valley was just beginning to thrive, before the Kingdom of Lefally or Ebonach existed, the digging up of Ignea by humans so agitated Eruta's sleeping body that a giant monster, bigger than any seen before, rose from the earth to destroy the valley settlements.

-- the demon

With the help of the Demon of Old, the people of Lefellen came to understand that the monster was Eruta's final warning. It was named the Messenger, and its "message" was from Eruta: "do not disturb me further, or else". Either the Messenger would succeeded in killing the humans where Eruta's common defenses had failed, or it would be slain by humans, indicating a grievous threat to Eruta and triggering its awakening and the subsequent near-instantaneous destruction of all life on its surface. Humanity was a fragile parasite on an incomprehensibly vast organism, and, it seems, stood no chance.

Because the Messenger aimed to destroy the human threat, and killing it was not an option, Lefellen's bravest citizens had no choice but to pacify it on the advice of the Demon of Old. A great and peculiar battle was fought to first subdue, and then befriend the strange, hulking monster, and the noble warrior of Lefellen who hosted the Demon of Old became the Messenger's Caretaker. The energy emitted by the Messenger afforded the ever-present Caretaker boundless vitality and shielded their body from decay. To keep the Messenger safe for all time, the Caretaker led it to a secluded cave outside Lefellen and had the cave sealed off, while the common citizens of Lefellen were told that the monster had been successfully slain and everyone was safe. The Caretaker was said to have gone on a sacred pilgrimmage following his victory. The Demon of Old faded gradually from his mind.

The humans of the time only dimly understood the cause of the Messenger's arrival, and further assumed the problem to be behind them. Mining of Ignea continued apace, and the people of Lefellen founded a new city to the south called Ebonach, and joined the two settlements into the Kingdom of Lefally. Hundreds of years passed. They fought further expansionary wars into the western plains, mining more rock to fuel more spells for more battles. The Messenger, anguished by this great attack upon the land, broke free from the Caretaker and vanished. Shortly after the Kingdom's victory in the Plains war, their new western settlements were obliterated by hordes of monsters, including a giant beast for which they had no answer and whose name had long since been lost to history.

The Caretaker, unaware and unconcerned with the events of the outside world, simply assumed the Messenger to have passed away, and speculated that he soon would too. Feeling the weight of many centuries on his psyche and thinking his task complete, he remained in the sealed cave to mourn the loss of the Messenger, his truest friend.

Within the Kingdom, monster attacks grew more vicious, their arrival often heralded by rumored sightings of a giant beast. The people of Lefally lost contact with other kingdoms and gave ground to the monsters. In a final, terrible blow, the giant monster appeared again to raze Lefellen after the newly crowned King Sinclair began constructing new mines there. The humans retreated to Ebonach, their last bastion, and searched desperately for solutions.

In the present day, a search party returns from the ruins of Lefellen with an ancient ritual scroll, said to summon a "Demon of Old". Despite myths of chaos and destruction surrounding the scroll, King Sinclair commands his knight Abelon to journey in a small party to the ritual site, to attempt to summon the demon and enlist its power. The fate of humanity hinges on the expedition's success.

## Timeline

#### The Time of Eruta

In ancient history, before humanity, the world was alive and uninhabitable. Creatures of land and sea could never survive upon the thrashing Eruta.

#### Around 2000 years Before the Kingdom (BTK)

Eruta enters a deep slumber. Flora and fauna begin to thrive on the sleeping land, and in time, humanity appears.

#### Year 223 BTK

Humans settling in the Red Mountain Valley found the town of Lefellen. The red dirt which they find in the earth, and which gives the mountains their name, has powerful energetic properties which help the town to thrive in the valley and in scuffles with neighbors.

#### Year 114 BTK

Humanity has become quite active in the Red Mountain Valley with the help of the red dirt, now known as Ignea. The slumbering Eruta conjures a giant monster which arrives near the city of Lefellen. Five heroes band together, aided by a demon summoned through an old ritual scroll, to subdue the creature. The demon advises them that they must not kill the monster, but instead care for it. One of the heroes, a noble knight and the demon's host, agrees to become the Caretaker, who will dedicate a now eternal life to feeding and sustaining the monster, which is named the Messenger. Its existence will be kept secret from the rest of the world, to keep the Messenger safe and not alarm the people; the Caretaker is said to the public to have gone on a sacred pilgrimmage, never to return. The Messenger's location is in a sealed cave deep in the Lefellen Forest.

#### Year 113 BTK

The demon fades from the mind of the Caretaker, leaving him only the Messenger for company.

#### Year 0 of the Kingdom

Ebonach is founded and settled by people of Lefellen. It will eventually become the capital city of the new united Kingdom of Lefally. Recorded history from around this time is sparse, and history before the Kingdom is almost non-existent.

#### Year 38 of the Kingdom

The Kingdom Archives are constructed, by coincidence, almost exactly atop the sealed cave in which the Messenger and Caretaker rest in the forests near Lefellen.

#### Year 421 of the Kingdom

Lefally begins a protracted war with a kingdom to the west, known as the Plains war.

#### Year 428 of the Kingdom

The Messenger, still under the care of the wizened Caretaker, begins to grow restless. The Caretaker tries every cure and remedy he has learned over his 500 years, to no avail.

#### Year 436 of the Kingdom

Mistram and other nearby mining towns are founded in territory claimed after victory in the Plains war, expanding Lefally to an empire of many cities. Lefally's bountiful supply of Ignea from the Red Mountains bolstered their spellcasters and ensured their eventual victory in the war, spurring them to build towns to tap the mountains on the west side of the valley for rich Ignea veins, so that Lefally's dominance would continue.

#### Year 449 of the Kingdom

Scholars, historians, and the King's Knight Captains begin to note a clear increase in the presence and aggression of local monsters.

#### Year 453 of the Kingdom

After becoming more and more agitated over thirty years, the Messenger suddenly disappears. Interpreting it as the death of the Messenger, the Caretaker remains, listless, mourning his old friend.

#### Year 454 of the Kingdom

An unprecedented attack from a coordinated swarm of monsters destroys Mistram and every western mining town over a series of weeks, despite reinforcements from the rest of the kingdom, and after rescuing many refugees, the territory is declared unsalvageable. Delirious refugees report seeing a giant monster amidst the chaos. From this point forward, monster attacks grow more and more frequent, a condition which comes to be known as the Despair.

#### Year 470 of the Kingdom

Prince Sinclair is born in Ebonach.

#### Year 473 of the Kingdom

Abelon is born in Ebonach. For his entire life, he is groomed to be the knight captain and right hand of the future King Sinclair, and the two become great friends.

#### Year 488 of the Kingdom

Shanti is born in Ebonach.

#### Year 493 of the Kingdom

Sinclair is crowned King of Lefally, and Abelon is named knight captain, the youngest ever to achieve the title.

#### Year 494 of the Kingdom

King Sinclair orders the construction of more mines in Lefellen to supply the soldiers with more Ignea.

#### Year 503 of the Kingdom

Lester is born in Ebonach.

#### Year 505 of the Kingdom

Kath is born in Lefellen to the city's renowned Knight Captain, Stefan.

#### Year 512 of the Kingdom

The Messenger appears again to raze Lefellen to the ground, killing Stefan, and Kath flees to Ebonach, one of few survivors. Without a second city to supply the Kingdom, the Despair grows ever more perilous. The Kingdom can only speculate about the origin of these giant monsters, and make preparations to deal with the day one inevitably attacks Ebonach.

#### Year 513 of the Kingdom

Executions of "dissedents" in Ebonach, ordered by the king, begin to rapidly accelerate, fostering unrest and destroying the king and Captain Abelon's reputations. Citizens speculate in private that King Sinclair, with one city left to defend, is in the grips of intense paranoia as the end of humanity approaches.

#### Year 514 of the Kingdom

Elaine is born in Ebonach.

#### Year 532 of the Kingdom

King Sinclair orders the summoning expedition. He meets privately with Abelon to impart special instruction that Abelon should perform the ritual, take command of the demon, and kill everyone else on the expedition before returning home to explain that they succumbed to monsters.

Elaine enters the northern forest in secret, though it is expressly forbidden, to hunt a rabbit or deer as a birthday meal for her little brother.
