# Chapter-by-chapter narrative summary

The game is divided into two parts. Each part consists of seven chapters. Each chapter contains exactly one "Battle", and may optionally contain "Roam" sequences where the player controls Abelon and can explore freely, and "Talk" sequences which are extended scenes of dialogue in which the player cannot move but may respond as Abelon.

# Part 1

## 1-1

**Roam:** The game begins alone, at night, in a forested clearing. The player controls Captain Abelon. They can wander through the forest.

A medallion can be found on the ground at any point during 1-1. It's use is not clear at this point.

**Battle:** The player immediately finds a wolf near an unconscious Elaine and dispatchs it in the tutorial battle.

**Roam:** Interacting with Elaine prompts you only to shake her, which does nothing. The player comes across the campfire with sleeping comrades in front of some stone reliefs. You can examine things around camp, go to bed, or select the dialogue option "kill them", if Elaine has not been carried to camp.

If you return to Elaine after having found the camp, you can optionally carry her to the camp, which results in different dialogue in 1-2, increased Elaine impression, and use of elaine in battle 1-2. It also locks the player out of the bad path, as Elaine cannot be left behind.

**Talk:** If you go to bed, the game fades to black. Abelon speaks to the player as ???, and the game transitions to 1-2. If you instead choose "kill them", Abelon slowly positions himself next to the camp, and begins drawing his sword, when the game cuts to black. Abelon speaks to the player as ???, and the game transitions to 1-5-a.

## 1-2

If you choose instead to go to sleep, you are woken up by Kath because wolves are circling. It's dawn. The other two have gone, because Lester woke up early and didn't feel like sitting around camp near Abelon. The subtext is that Lester hates Abelon. Abelon and Kath fend off the wolves. Elaine arrives; the dead wolf alerted her that there were people nearby, and she followed the blood and tracks to the conflict. She thanks the knights for dealing with the wolf chasing her, then collapses.

Elaine's presence explains the wolves; Abelon had already fought one, there's a pack nearby. This is the first Kath learns of the encounter though. He is confused as to why Abelon didn't notify everyone. The two discuss some before Kath feeds her and they rest awhile while she recovers.

Abelon and Kath decide what to do with her. It's a two-day journey back to Ebonach through dense forest, so it would be difficult to go back alone. After figuring out how she ended up so far from the city, Kath proposes that she accompany them for the duration of the expedition.

Abelon may suspect she is tailing them for nefarious purposes or is otherwise simply not worth their energy, since she is in defiance of the law and sheltering her would endanger their expedition. Taking her home would waste too much time. If all dissenting arguments are made, go to 1-3-a. Otherwise, Elaine joins the party. Kath will express surprise if Abelon readily assents, while both Kath and Elaine will acknowledge Abelon's callous nature when he resists. She resolves to fight with her bow. Kath explains what they're there for, for Elaine's benefit, and that Lester and Shanti have gone on ahead. They move to regroup and continue the search.

Getting Elaine up to speed is a good opportunity to fill in the relevant context.

## 1-3

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- The three go after Shanti and Lester (roam, talk). After going ahead, Elaine and Kath catch up, brief discussion. Where did the two go? Need to find them. Roam, chat, solve environmental puzzle, find goodies, etc. Can encounter the magical barrier of the monastery.
- find them in a predicament with mysterious stone monsters, Lester incapacitated (battle: elaine kath abelon shanti).
- Resolve the encounter, but Lester is unconscious. Need to heal him. Shanti has realized that the monastery they are looking for is magically guarded somehow (talk).
- Follow trail of Shanti's discovery, solve the puzzle of the magical ward, find monastery entrance (roam).
- On finding it, Abelon briefly is able to talk to the player (as ???). Angry, confused, vague. Not clear that it is Abelon speaking. Perhaps in "broad daylight", not as a black screen? (talk).

Regardless of whether Elaine is taken or not, we find Lester and Shanti in their own predicament. They had gone on assuming themselves to be in a safe area, but strange living rock creatures corner them – defenders created by the Caretaker, who has sensed their presence, to keep people away. A battle ensues to reconvene with Shanti and Lester. Lester is incapacitated, and needs healing.

Shanti made a small discovery, leading to some roaming while Kath heals Lester, in which the player discovers an entrance to the monastery ruins. Alone after finding it, Abelon is able to talk to the player. He is angry, confused, and vague. It is not at all clear to the player that the voice is coming from Abelon.

## 1-4

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- Lester is awake, discuss Elaine outside the entrance (talk). Lester finds it hilarious that she got lost by going the wrong way, Shanti points out that kids don't learn geography anymore.
- Open entrance, triggers battle outside. Part 1 midboss, two forest terrors, along with wolves (battle).
- It's not safe to stay aboveground. Make camp inside monastery ruins. Can start finding Gaheris' journals (roam).
- The party wonders why they in particular have been chosen for this expedition. The cover, of course, is that they are the trusted elite, but that doesn't necessarily seem true on a close inspection. (talk)
- At night, Abelon speaks again. Saving Elaine affected him. He is mad about it, wouldn't have done that. But, he concedes... she is useful. Still angry, fighting for control, doesn't feel confident to take it (talk).

## 1-5

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- seek the truth, and the ritual site, in the monastery sanctum ruins. Find out it must be farther in. (roam)
- Learn something important. First piece of the puzzle put together for Shanti.
- find trouble. More stone monsters, and suits of armor. First suspect they are soldiers, then that they are empty, then finally find out they have corpses in them. Gross! (battle). Kath is not in this one for some reason.
- post mortem, big revelations; there's more going on here than just finding a ritual site (talk)

## 1-6

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- more truth-learning, this time in the underground library and dorms. (talk)
- more trouble. Proactive battle. Zombie monks animated by ignea? (battle). Shanti and Kath not in this one for some reason.
- revelations in the library, lots of books to read, something about the giant monster? (talk)
- Make camp in a dorm. Realize it's the turn of the new year. Kath brought party favors! (roam).
- At night, Abelon ponders killing the party. Decides against it. Needs to know more. Frustrated. On the verge of gaining control. Addresses the demon directly, ponders it (talk).

Party celebrates the turn of the new year over a campfire. Abelon can act vaguely out of character (e.g. too happy) under the influence of the player.

## 1-7

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- party makes their way to important-seeming site in the basement. Feel they are on the cusp of learning the truth. And performing the ritual. Realize there may be more at stake than then ritual. (talk)
- Abelon, in frustration, decides to trust the party instead of killing them and tell them what is happening to him as he can't see a way forward otherwise, asks for help (talk)
- Before we can learn much, disaster strikes (battle)
- Kath saves Abelon, party is split, Kath and Abelon thrown into cave below (talk)

When abelon takes helmet off, blank dialogue responses. He says hes tired of being forced into this farce, the summoning already happened, and he needs help. Then disaster strikes

# Part 2

## 2-1

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- Truths revealed in deep discussion while clearing away stones to form an exit. Kath's history, why he saved Abelon, the murder plot, Abelon's possession (talk, roam).
- They find Mona, hooded, and give chase in a battle. Driven into a corner, she summons stone monsters (battle).
- Who the heck is Mona. Alive for so long! And has demon! (talk).

Just Abelon and Kath here.

Learn that Abelon would not have saved Elaine without being possessed.

Learn that Kath’s dad Stefan is the old third knight captain. Friend of Abelon’s. Not a great dude, kinda like Abelon. Prioritized his home of Lefally over Kath, after helping him escape the giant monster, Stefan went back into the blaze. Kath resolved to never do that, so he is kind. Kath hates that Abelon reminds him of his dad, but can't help but admire the old knight.

At the end of their discussion, Abelon asks Kath if they are friends. Kath concludes, basically yes.

Kath and Abelon’s battle alone is because the caretaker flees from them, hooded, and summons more golems to defend herself. But when cornered, must explain that she only wanted to observe longer.

## 2-2

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- Revelations through talking with Mona, mostly about the Demon and its role in helping the people of the past. Abelon is shocked to hear they were friends. Player may respond that it knows Mona (same demon) or doesn't (different demon) (talk).
- Investigate something (roam).
- Environmental battle, falling rocks and such. Mona left behind. Going outside from the cave, emerge at the monastery approach (same place as 1-3) (battle).

Abelon wants to kill her but Kath reminds him there’s more to learn. Question the caretaker about why she attacked, why she’s here, how she sensed them. Its a long story, she says, first she has pressing questions of her own. Player can respond to this, either option she interjects, there it is again! She recognizes the demon. Shift to talking about that until she leaves them behind when the cave collapses.

## 2-3

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- Find the others, they learned stuff too! Shanti will tell the story...
- Take control of Shanti, with Lester and Elaine, as they learn that there's something to be done here more important than any ritual. The ruins hold secrets about this giant monster, and the learn its true nature. They also chat, about themselves and about Abelon and Kath. NO roaming (talk).
- Shanti finds the giant store of ignea in the sanctum here. Also explores the library.
- Shanti goes looking for monsters to confirm her findings; ignea re-animates them. (battle)
- They hear a quake and go to the monastery approach where Abelon and Kath emerged
from the tunnel (talk).

As the three chat, something like the following conversation occurs.

Lester: We need to find Captain Kath.
Elaine: Lester... You don't like Sir Abelon very much, do you?
Lester: Hmph. Does anyone? He's a heartless bastard. Sure, he knows his way around a blade, and a battlefield. But he's the tyrant's lapdog. That's all there is to say.
Shanti: Tyrant's lapdog? Slanderous words, Lester, if I've ever heard any. Do you keep such a loose tongue in town as well? It could get you in trouble.
Lester: Oh, am I not in good company? You know, Shanti, my mother followed your research quite closely. I recall the two of you even met privately in our home a few evenings, before she was murdered.
Lester: That was what, fifteen years ago? I was still in school. And even then you were looking into the correlations between mining operations, ignea usage, and monster attacks. What have you found since, I wonder? Anything that might put a target on your back?
Shanti: I am only interested in the answers my research leads me to. I try not to concern myself with King Sinclair and his preoccupations.
Lester: Oh? But I'm sure he very much concerns himself with your work. And any work that might undermine his reputation.
Elaine: Wait, why would finding a connection between mining, ignea, and monsters matter to His Majesty?
Lester: Well, think about it. Imagine if one day it came out that monsters have been after Ebonach more and more lately because of all of the ignea we've been mining.
Lester: Meanwhile Sinclair has been ordering the construction of new ignea mines, and conscripting kids into the military so they can learn to cast spells with ignea. Meaning everything he's done to fight off the monsters has been making the problem worse all along!
Lester: He'd look like a complete fool. Which he is.
Elaine: Is that true? If we closed down the mines, would the monsters go away?
Lester: If you ask me... hold on, Elaine, don't go saying anything like this around Ebonach or to your friends, ok? It could get your family in trouble.
Shanti: No, no, carry on Lester. I want to know what you think. What would happen if we closed all of the mines? Stopped using spells in battle?
Lester: Well, I wager the monsters would leave us alone. You tell me! You're the one who's figured out the two are related.
Shanti: I haven't "figured out" anything. I suspect. I investigate. And what if I were wrong? If we collapsed the mines, threw our gemstones into the Ebon, and wolves came howling at the gates? We'd be overrun within the week.
Lester: Hey, come on. I didn't mean... I wasn't trying to say it was that simple.
Lester: Whatever. None of that matters unless we find Captain Kath and get out of here.

*Later*

Elaine: Well, I like Sir Abelon. He saved my life! And he and Sir Kath agreed to take me with you all, even though I've been nothing but a burden.
Lester: With the way this expedition has been going, joining us was more a curse than a blessing...
Shanti: It's admirable you've kept your head, Elaine. Figuratively. And literally, I suppose. I'm sure all of this has been quite overwhelming for you.
Elaine: Thank you, Shanti. I guess when all of you are able to stay so calm, I feel reassured...
Lester: Actually, it's been bothering me. Abelon going out of the way to take on some useless baggage–
Shanti: *Ahem*
Lester: ...er, sorry Elaine. I shouldn't have put it quite like that.
Elaine: No, you're right. I haven't been very useful...
Lester: The point is, it's just not like him. And then there's everything he was saying about not being in control of himself, and for a second he looked so... I don't know, I've never seen him look that way before.
Shanti: It was a peculiar outburst. I'm not sure there's much more to say. Not until we find him and ask him ourselves.
Lester: There's plenty else I'd like to ask him about...

Learn that Lester became a knight to surpass Abelon and take his place as captain. Only cares to follow Kath.

## 2-4

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- Outside the Monastery, Abelon and Kath combine what they learned with the others. Now they know what must be done. We know there's a Messenger, and we should find it and deal with it. But it's supposed to be in the caretaker's cave, which collapsed, find another entrance. (talk).
- Finding a the other entrance to the cave, put more puzzle pieces together, proactive battle that is forced because we're going into the cave again (battle).
- Prepare to make camp inside because anything could happen (roam). 
- When settling down, in a moment alone, Abelon confides in the demon (talk).

For 2-4 we go back to having the player doing a decent amount of the talking for Abelon, but he pipes in every now and again. It is a little awkward when you both have control, but it seems that Abelon is beginning not to resent the player. He is confused about it. Culminates in him confiding in the demon and understanding that he needs to get it off his chest. The demon can agree, or not.

By the time we reach battle 10 (reunite w/ elaine/shanti/lester) the caretaker helped abelon put the puzzle pieces together, and the other three have the last missing piece of info. We know what needs to be done. Before battle 10 discussion of what needs to be done and sharing of knowledge. Battle 10 is a proactive step, not an ambush.

- Before settling down, Abelon comes clean. Explains his possession, to much skepticism. Finally, the punchline: memory scene where king explains the murder plot to Abelon (talk).
- Astonishment. Abelon would have killed them all the first night if he hadn't been possessed. Lester gets pissed, not going to make camp with Abelon, runs out into the forest (talk).
- Go after Lester in the dark (roam).
- Unintended monster battle in darkness, pissed off forest terrors and wolves, Elaine sticks up for Abelon in mid-battle cutaways (battle).
- Lester and Abelon fight (talk).

We begin with a big reveal memory, after Abelon talks to the player alone and rejoins the others to settle down for camp.

Abelon first shares the nature of his possession and the reason for his outburst in 1-7. He recalls arriving at the monastery ruins and offering to take the second watch. Upon being woken up for the second watch, he absconded into the trees and performed the summoning ritual out of sight, at which point he became possessed by the Demon of Old identified by the scroll. The party is skeptical, and confused as to why he performed the summoning. Abelon, to explain, tells the story of when the King entrusted him with the scroll.

In the throne room, King Sinclair gives Abelon the scroll and they chat. The king is sober, cold, calculating, and slightly paranoid, but he treats Abelon as a genuine comrade. He tells Abelon there is no ritual site; while the scroll makes mention of the monastery where it was penned 500 years ago, there is no specification that the ritual must be done there. King Sinclair wants Abelon to summon the demon and use its power to kill the party once they have reached the monastery ruins, far from the city. He wants to kill the party because they are too smart and have different ideas on how to solve the problem (e.g. stop mining ignea, etc). He fears they will oppose him. Kath is a public hero, so executing him is no good. The expedition is a strong excuse; they will die valiantly in battle. The king believes power will save the kingdom, and has placed his bet on the ritual scroll. He is ultimately wrong, but given the state of things, it’s not an unfathomable point of view. The king trusts Abelon and confides in him like a friend. He is not evil, but he is cunning and believes in his own authority by birthright. Abelon has absolute faith in the King, and considers the king his only friend. It is the two of them against the masses, acting in the peoples’ best interest and enduring their ire. Abelon has embraced this role fully and is not accustomed to thinking for himself. The scene closes with the king apologizing for asking Abelon to kill Kath, as Kath is a good friend. Abelon responds frankly by saying Kath is not his friend.

The party comes to the realization that, after summoning the demon, Abelon intended to kill the group on his return to camp, and would have done so if not for his possession.

Lester is infuriated and runs from camp into forest.

After the party chases lester after big reveal scene, elaine has a hero moment of advocating for abelon, saying she was scared but just doesnt think he could do those things. But monsters appear. Afterwards, he and abelon fight, no player intervention. Lester just needed some time to cool off, he regrets endangering them. But Kath saying abelon was just following kings orders sets lester off. Lester claims Abelon believed he was right, always. Abelon says lester’s mom isnt innocent, reveals what lester’s mom did (kill soldier in home invasion to investigate/find treasonous documents). Lester furious, i dont believe this, did you come after me just to goad me into killing you, but when pressed Abelon says he wouldnt do it again. Lester demands to know abelon isnt just fishing for forgiveness. No forgiveness. Abelon doesnt lie. Return to the caretaker's cave.

- Mona arrives and shares the rest of her knowledge, confirming much of what they've learned and shedding additional light on the Messenger and its history. She expresses shame that she did not know it was wrecking the world. She did not know ignea was the problem, Shanti found that out. She believes she can summon it here, but the heroes must pacify it (talk).
- Make camp and prepare for the final battle. After going to sleep, Abelon talks to the demon frankly, finally. Expresses his pain. The player may say sorry, which Abelon finds as a great comfort, because it confirms that the demon is something close to humans, or at least understands them. Either way, he expresses gratitude (roam).
- Final battle (battle)
- Post mortem, final truths and reflections (talk).
- Option to pack up and go home, or proceed to final final challenge. Can check on everyone to see what they're thinking of doing. Some secrets are still buried (roam).
- If not doing final challenge, fast-forward to epilogue (talk)

Mona arrives to share the rest of what she knows.

Final battle

The player can choose whether or not to continue to the ultimate battle (2-7) or end the game with the expedition a success. Mona strenuously advises against continuing, almost but not quite to the point of fourth wall breaking (i.e. don't continue unless you are very, very skilled). Ending the game here skips to the epilogue, with some changes.

## 2-7

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- If choose to do final challenge, full ignea refill, do battle with infinite ignea in the great sanctum store. Subdue the ignea heart so it cannot re-summon a messenger! (battle)
- Talk about victory (talk)

Ultimate battle

## Epilogue

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

Timeskip forward into a scene where an older Abelon speaks to the suddenly stirring demon as an old friend. Having completed 2-7 has some details changed to reflect a more "complete" golden path ending. Depending on the party's impressions of Abelon, their fates and the way he relays them in this scene may also be slightly different.

## Bad path

## 1-3-a

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

By arguing strenuously, Abelon can convince Kath to send Elaine home on the forest road with three days rations, by pointing out that they don't have the food to keep her around for potentially a week or more during the search, defending a fifth person who is dead weight in a fight would imperil them all, and she was never allowed to leave the city to begin with. She may be a spy. The importance of the mission's prompt success is also a concern. Kath will provide her food and advice to get back to the city, and the pair will continue north remorsefully. Elaine will still be grateful that Abelon saved her at all.

- The two go after Shanti and Lester (talk)
- Find them in a predicament with mysterious stone monsters (battle).
- Resolve the encounter. This time, Lester not incapacitated. Shanti made a small discovery (talk).
- Follow trail of Shanti's discovery, find next place to go (roam).
- On finding it Abelon briefly is able to talk to the player (as ???). Confident, Demon understands him, prepared to proceed (talk).

## 1-4-a

TODO: ROUGH DRAFT

- Discuss the next place to go (talk).
- It's underground, opening pathway triggers a fight (battle).
- Make camp (roam).
- At night, Abelon talks to the player. Understanding. Says he can control the power, and that it is a kindred spirit; they will have a long and fruitful partnership. Wakes up, kills everyone (talk).

- Timeskip forward. Abelon falls alone to the horde, despite infinite Ignea and OP abilities (battle).
