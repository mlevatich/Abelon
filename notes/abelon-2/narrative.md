## Chronological story

With the Despair looming over the city, the King has decided to take a drastic course of action. A search party has returned from the ruins of Lefellen with an ancient ritual scroll, containing preparatory steps and incantations necessary to summon and command what is supposedly an astonishingly powerful "Demon of Old". The King sends both Abelon and Kath, another accomplished knight Lester, and Ebonach's premier Ignaeic scholar Shanti on an expedition north to the ritual site. Abelon leads the group, which is ostensibly small in an attempt to avoid detection and not leave the city defenseless.

Before the events of the game Abelon gets told to do the ritual early and kill everyone with the demon.

The four make their way into the forest towards the ruins of Lefellen, with the hopes of humanity pinned on their success. They make it through much of the forest without incident, a journey of three days on an overgrown road, and camp for the third night in some ruins on the outskirts of Lefellen. Abelon offers to take the second watch. Upon being woken up for the second watch, Abelon absconds to a nearby clearing to perform the summoning ritual out of sight, feeling the party far enough from Ebonach to hide evidence of foul play, and close enough to Lefellen for the ritual to work.

#### 1-1

The game begins alone, at night, in a forested clearing. Abelon was on watch and stepped away to perform a ritual. Of course, the player doesn't know that. The player can only wander through the forest at night. They immediately find a wolf near an unconscious Elaine and dispatch it in the tutorial battle before coming across the campfire with sleeping comrades in front of the entrance to some sort of ruins. Interacting with Elaine doesn't prompt you to do anything (maybe shake her). You can examine things around camp, go to bed, or select the dialogue option "kill them". This option prompts Abelon to slowly position himself next to the camp, and begin drawing his sword, when the game cuts to black. Over a black screen, the following dialogue from Abelon, listed as ???, plays:
???: "I see..."
???: "Then I was overly concerned. This power..."
???: "...is mine to command."
The game then transitions to 1-2-a.

#### 1-2

If you choose instead to go to sleep, you are woken up by Kath because wolves are circling. It's dawn. The other two have gone, because Lester woke up early and didn't feel like sitting around camp near Abelon. Abelon and Kath fend off the wolves. Elaine arrives; the dead wolf alerted her that there were people nearby, and she followed the blood and tracks to the conflict. She thanks the knights for dealing with the wolf chasing her, then collapses.

Elaine's presence explains the wolves; Abelon had already fought one, there's a pack nearby. This is the first Kath learns of the encounter though. He is confused as to why Abelon didn't notify everyone. The two discuss some before Kath feeds her and they rest awhile while she recovers.

Abelon and Kath decide what to do with her. It's a three-day journey back to Ebonach, so it would be difficult to go back alone. After figuring out how she ended up so far from the city, (TODO) Kath proposes that she accompany them for the duration of the expedition.

If all dissenting arguments are made, go to 1-3-a. Otherwise, Elaine joins the party. Kath will express surprise if Abelon readily assents, while both Kath and Elaine will acknowledge Abelon's callous nature when he resists. She resolves to fight with her bow. Kath explains what they're there for, for Elaine's benefit, and that Lester and Shanti have gone on ahead. They move to regroup and continue the search.

#### 1-3

Regardless of whether Elaine is taken or not, we find Lester and Shanti in their own predicament. A battle ensues to rescue Shanti. Shanti/Lester went on cause they thought safe, no wolves in ruins, only forest. But strange living rock creatures corner them - defenders of the messenger, created by the caretaker to keep people away.

As the three chat, something like the following conversation occurs.

Lester: We need to find Captain Kath.

Elaine: Lester... You don't like Sir Abelon very much, do you?

Lester: Hmph. Does anyone? He's a heartless bastard. Sure, he knows his way around a blade, and a battlefield. But he's the tyrant's lapdog. That's all there is to say.

Shanti: Tyrant's lapdog? Slanderous words, Lester, if I've ever heard any. Do you keep such a loose tongue in town as well? It could get you in trouble.

Lester: Oh, am I not in good company? You know, Shanti, my mother followed your research quite closely. I recall the two of you even met privately in our home a few evenings, before she was murdered.

Lester: That was what, fifteen years ago? I was still in school. And even then you were looking into the correlations between mining operations, ignea usage, and monster attacks. What have you found since, I wonder? Anything that might put a target on your back?

Shanti: I am only interested in the answers my research leads me to. I try not to concern myself with King Sinclair and his preoccupations.

Lester: Oh? But I'm sure he very much concerns himself with your work. And any work that might undermine his reputation.

Elaine: Wait, why would finding a connection between mining, ignea, and monsters matter to His Majesty?

Lester: Well, think about it. Imagine if one day it came out that monsters have been after Ebonach more and more lately because of all of the ignea we've been mining.

Lester: Meanwhile Sinclair has been ordering the construction of new ignea mines, and conscripting kids into the military so they can learn to cast spells with ignea. Meaning everything he's done to fight off the monsters has been making the problem worse all along!

Lester: He'd look like a complete fool. Which he is.

Elaine: Is that true? If we closed down the mines, would the monsters go away?

Lester: If you ask me... hold on, Elaine, don't go saying anything like this around Ebonach or to your friends, ok? It could get your family in trouble.

Shanti: No, no, carry on Lester. I want to know what you think. What would happen if we closed all of the mines? Stopped using spells in battle?

Lester: Well, I wager the monsters would leave us alone. You tell me! You're the one who's figured out the two are related.

Shanti: I haven't "figured out" anything, Lester. I suspect. I investigate. And what if I were wrong? If we collapsed the mines, threw our gemstones into the Ebon, and wolves came howling at the gates? We'd be overrun within the week.

Lester: Hey, come on. I didn't mean... I wasn't trying to say it was that simple.

Lester: Whatever. None of that matters unless we find Captain Kath and get out of here.

*Later*

Elaine: Well, I like Sir Abelon. He saved my life! And he and Sir Kath agreed to take me with you all, even though I've been nothing but a burden.

Lester: With the way this expedition has been going, joining us was more a curse than a blessing...

Shanti: It's admirable you've kept your head, Elaine. Figuratively. And literally, I suppose. I'm sure all of this has been quite overwhelming for you.

Elaine: Thank you, Shanti. I guess when all of you are able to stay so calm, I feel reassured...

Lester: Actually, it's been bothering me. Abelon going out of the way to take on some useless baggage–

Shanti: *Ahem*

Lester: ...er, sorry Elaine. I shouldn't have put it quite like that.

Elaine: No, you're right. I haven't been very useful...

Lester: The point is, it's just not like him. And then there's everything he was saying about not being in control of himself, and for a second he looked so... I don't know, I've never seen him look that way before.

Shanti: It was a peculiar outburst. I'm not sure there's much more to say. Not until we find him and ask him ourselves.

Lester: There's plenty else I'd like to ask him about...

#### 2-4

By the time we reach battle 10 (reunite w/ elaine/shanti/lester) the caretaker helped abelon put the puzzle pieces together, and the other three have the last missing piece of info. We know what needs to be done. Before battle 10 discussion of what needs to be done and sharing of knowledge. Battle 10 is a proactive step, not an ambush. After battle 10, big reveal memory.

#### 2-5

After the party chases lester after big reveal scene, elaine has a hero moment of advocating for abelon, saying she was scared but just doesnt think he could do those things. But monsters appear. Afterwards, he and abelon fight, no player intervention. Lester just needed some time to cool off, he regrets endangering them. But Kath saying abelon was just following kings orders sets lester off. Lester claims Abelon believed he was right, always. Abelon says lester’s mom isnt innocent, reveals what lester’s mom did (kill soldier in home invasion to investigate/find treasonous documents). Lester furious, i dont believe this, did you come after me just to goad me into killing you, but when pressed Abelon says he wouldnt do it again. Lester demands to know abelon isnt just fishing for forgiveness. No forgiveness. Abelon doesnt lie.

## Bad path

#### 1-2-a

Triggered if Abelon ends 1-1 by killing the party. Identical to 1-5-a.

#### 1-3-a

By arguing strenuously, Abelon can convince Kath to send Elaine home on the forest road with three days rations, by pointing out that they don't have the food to keep her around for potentially a week or more during the search, defending a fifth person who is dead weight in a fight would imperil them all, and she was never allowed to leave the city to begin with. The severity of the mission's success is also a concern. Kath will provide her food and advice to get back to the city, and the pair will continue north remorsefully. Elaine will still be grateful that Abelon saved her at all.
