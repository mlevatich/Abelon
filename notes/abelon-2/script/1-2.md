# 1-2 Script

## Introduction

*The chapter begins over a black screen, with "1-2" displayed in the corner.*

Kath speaks:
```
???: Abelon, wake up. Quickly.

???: And fetch your scabbard. Abelon?

-> Event: Scene fades in. Abelon and Kath stand outside of their camp beds. Kath has his weapon drawn. If carried-elaine, she is also nearby. The other two camp beds are empty.

???: Can you sense it? They're hanging back for now, watching us. But they'll attack soon enough.

A: Yes

A: What?

    ???: Wolves, Abelon. Hurry and shake off whatever dreams you were having, and draw your sword.

-> Event: Abelon draws his sword.

???: Ach, this is exactly what I was afraid would happen. Can't Lester ever just sit still? Blasted fool.

A: Where are they?

    -LABEL A-
    ???: Lester woke up early and announced he was heading towards the ruins to start looking for the ritual site. I told him it was idiotic to go alone, of course, but he wasn't having it.

    ???: More likely is he didn't want to linger around camp with you here. I'm sure you're aware he's not exactly fond of you.

    A: An understatement

        ???: Well, I can only assure you it wasn't my influence. He may be a knight under my command, but I didn't teach him to disrespect you.

        A: Naturally

            ???: Naturally...

        A: I appreciate it (Kath +1i)

            ???: You appreciate that I... haven't been slandering you behind your back.
            
            ???: I suppose I shouldn't be surprised your standards are low for such things.

        A: So you're an admirer of mine? (Kath +1a)

            ???: Ha.

    A: Is he not? (Kath +1a)

        ???: Are you... Was that a joke, old man? We've heard nothing but dour muttering and veiled insults from him ever since he was assigned to this expedition.

        ???: One would think he'd be honored to have been chosen to join us. But having to take orders from Captain Abelon has ruined it for him, I suppose.

        A: You sound resentful

            ???: Yes, that I have to listen to his complaining. But don't mistake me – he's served under me for years, and we've been friends for even longer. It would be more odd if he didn't annoy me time and again.

            ???: He's a peerless warrior. Present company excluded, of course. But I'm grateful to have him along.

        A: He should count himself lucky

            ???: Hm. Does a knight ever consider himself lucky to be given a task of unparalleled danger? There's no guarantee that this ritual works, or that we even return alive... But I digress.

    A: He has no right (Abelon +1)

        ???: I couldn't disagree more, Abelon. History will judge whether His Majesty made the right decision, but what it put Lester's family through... no one should have to endure that.

        A: Yet he became a knight

            ???: On the condition that he would serve under me, and not you, yes. And he rather quickly became my best warrior. But one does wonder why he would volunteer to directly serve the King, after all that happened.

        A: Many have endured worse

            ???: And so will affairs in the city continue, until the shroud of Despair is lifted from Ebonach and monsters plague us no more. On that, at least, we will always agree.

    A: I can hardly blame him (Kath +1a)

        ???: I'm... surprised to hear you say that. You've not once seemed apologetic about the whole affair in the entire time I've known you.

        A: I'm not, but I understand his anger

            ???: Yes, it was... awful. For everyone involved. I know His Majesty felt it was necessary but... ah, it's not the time nor place to dwell on it.

        A: It was a mistake (Kath +1a, Abelon -1)

            -> Flag: abelon-mistake

            ???: ...

            ???: Do you... actually mean that? By the goddess, it's like you've woken up a different person. I don't believe it... and I wonder how Lester would react...

    *If not carried-elaine*
    ???: In any case, since there was no swaying him, I had Shanti go with him. Better that we move in pairs, in the event that... something exactly like this happens.

    *otherwise*
    ???: In any case, since there was no swaying him, I had Shanti go with him. She was dreadfully curious about this child you brought back to camp, of course, but we'll have to discuss further when we rejoin them. I must say, I'm terribly interested as well...

A: Who are you? (Kath +1a, Abelon -1)

    ???: What? Goddess, Abelon, wake yourself up already! You aren't old enough to be getting senile yet! Here, you were asleep, so I'll fill you in.

    -GOTO A-

-> Event: The screen pans around. Three wolves emerge from the forest.

???: Time enough for talking later. Here they come.
```

## Battle 1-2

*The player enters the battle preparation menu. Abelon and Kath are next to each other, with three wolves surrounding them. The enemies are positioned such that it is impossible to win the battle in fewer than three turns, even on Normal.*

A battle tutorial appears on the right side of the screen during ally phase 1:
```
After using an attack or spell and finishing their movement, an ally may use an 'Assist' skill, aimed at some set tiles.

Until the next ally phase, any ally standing on an assisted tile benefits from the effects of the skill. Numerical effects are calculated from the caster's attributes.

Position allies to attack from tiles with offensive assists, or end their actions on tiles with defensive assists. With three or more allies, one unit can even benefit from multiple assists at the same time.
```

Ally phase 1 begins:
```
???: Right, we'll do the usual song and dance then. The young upstart will take his orders from the grumpy old man.

Kath: Captain Kath of Lefellen, at your command!
```

First time selecting Abelon or Kath:
```
Kath: We ought to stay close if possible, so we can assist each other.

Kath: We're surrounded, but we can't let them attack as a group... Best to strike quickly and finish off one of them to buy ourselves some space.
```

Abelon uses Conflagration or Crucible for the first time
```
Kath: By Ignus, what the hell did you just do, Abelon? I've never seen such unbelievable magic!

A: You haven't? (Kath +1a)

    Kath: No, I haven't, in all the countless battles I've fought by your side. You aren't really trying to tell me you've been conjuring hellfire all this time and I just wasn't paying attention!

A: A useful spell I recently learned

    Kath: ...You have a habit of understating things somewhat.

Kath: Well, I insist you teach me that incantation when we return to town. 

Kath: Oh, but don't waste your entire supply of Ignea on a mere few wolves. I expect we'll face many more battles before we return to Ebonach, and I can tell that was no cheap cantrip.
```

First wolf dies:
```
Kath: Good.
```

Kath dies:
```
Kath: Urgh. Damn, hurts........ But I refuse... to........
```

Abelon dies:
```
Kath: Abelon, no! NO!
```

Enemy phase 1 begins:
```
Kath: Watch yourself, Abelon!
```

An ignea tutorial appears on the right side of the screen during ally phase 2, replacing the assist tutorial:
```
Many powerful skills consume Ignea, listed as their 'Cost'. Ignea is a precious stone, and each unit in battle has a limited supply, shown in their Attributes.

Be careful with these skills – to recover Ignea, you will have to find it on your journey.

On Master difficulty, no Ignea is restored after battle / On Adept difficulty, 25% of each ally's maximum Ignea is restored after battle / On Normal difficulty, 50% of each ally's maximum Ignea is restored after battle
```

Ally phase 3 begins and carried-elaine:
```
???: Mmh...

Kath: About time she started coming to. She doesn't look in any state to use her bow, but I at least hope she has enough sense not to draw attention to herself...
```

Ally phase 3 begins and not carried-elaine:
```
-> Event: Screen pans southwest to reveal Elaine walking slowly.

???: I'm sure it was... this way... ...What? Are they... fighting? They must be the ones...

Kath: What the– Abelon! There's a person! A young girl, do you see her? By the Goddess, what is she doing out here?

A: I came across her last night (Kath +1a)

    Kath: You what? Abelon, we're two days out from town! Did you not think it was worth stopping to help her, or at least waking up the camp to inform us?

    A: I assumed she was dead

        Kath: A reasonable assumption this far from Ebonach, but given that she clearly isn't a rotting corpse, you might've at least checked...

    A: The King's graces do not extend past the city limits (Abelon +1, Kath -1i)

        Kath: I understand she's in violation of the Kingdom's laws, but isn't it more important that she's alone and clearly in need of help? Honestly, Abelon, I'll never understand you...

A: Kath. Eyes on the enemy (Abelon +1)

    Kath: Yes, of course, I'm just... the last thing I expected to see was another person this deep in the forest...

Kath: Ach, we'll deal with her after the wolves are dead. Hopefully she doesn't draw any attention to herself.
```

On ally phase 3, the Attributes tutorial is shown on the right, replacing the Ignea tutorial:
```
The capabilities of a unit are summarized by their 'Attributes'.

Endurance determines a unit's maximum health, and Focus determines their maximum Ignea usage.

Force determines the effectiveness of many attacks and spells, and Affinity determines the effectiveness of many assists.

Every point of Reaction reduces Weapon Damage by one. Spell Damage bypasses Reaction.

Every four points of Agility confers one tile of movement in battle.
```

On ally phase 4 and beyond, the following message replaces the tutorials:
```
All battle tutorials are now available for review under 'Tutorials' in the 'Settings' menu.

To access the 'Settings' and other game information during battle, select any empty tile by pressing F.
```

After victory:
```
Kath: *Huff* Hah, it's over. Poor beasts. Someone should have told them they were picking a fight with the greatest knights in all the Kingdom!

A: The greatest knights?

    Kath: What, you disagree?

    A: I suppose not (Kath +1i)

        Kath: Precisely.

    A: You aren't yet worthy of that title

        Kath: Bah! Says the old man to the youngest Knight Captain in the Kingdom's history. And it won't be long before I finally best you in a proper duel, either. Time is on my side, Abelon.

    A: I'm not quite worthy of that title (Kath +1a, Abelon -1)

        Kath: ...Is that your attempt at a joke? If there isn't a knight in Ebonach who can match you in a duel, who exactly are you competing with?

        Kath: Unless you think the title of "greatest" implies a winning personality. In which case, yes, you're dead last.

A: Kath, the girl

    Kath: Of course.

A: ...

Kath: Now then...
```

## Dealing with Elaine (If carried-elaine)

Elaine asks for food, she eats.

She thanks them for killing the wolf. Kath is confused.

Abelon explains the encounter.

Elaine thanks the knights profusely, having learned their identities. (Elaine receives some kind of buff or acknowledgement here for having been carried)

Kath confirms this is why they were attacked again, there is a pack. They shouldn't linger.

Who is Elaine? How did she get so far from the city? Is she a spy (only an option if didn't carry her)? Digesting and understanding her story. She left to catch a rabbit, chased it too far, got lost, chased by wolves into night, made camp, woke up, walked the wrong way because she thought the sun rose in the west.

Kath's proposal: Too dangerous to send home, she comes with.
Abelon may dissent. If too many dissenting options are chosen, Kath will simply insist that Abelon has overplayed his hand by bringing her to camp in the first place, and that the kindness should not go to waste.

Elaine is coming with! She needs to be prepared. Explaining the mission and packing up.

Lead on, Abelon! Roam north (can't go south) to transition to 1-3

If not carried-elaine, same as above but:
    Extra scene of getting her to sit down in camp
    Can accuse her of being a spy
    No buff/acknowledgement of being carried
    If Abelon chooses all dissenting options, Kath will relent and send her home with rations, giving directions and advice.
