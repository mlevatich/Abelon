# 1-1 Script

## Introduction

*The chapter begins over a black screen, with "1-1" displayed in the corner.*

A voice over the black screen:
```
???: ...

???: ............

???: ...Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

???: ..................

???: ..!
```

## Roam the forest

*The scene slowly fades in, with the camera centered on Abelon in a forested clearing. Abelon stands in what appears to be a ritual circle. On the ground nearby is a small scroll. The player may control Abelon and wander around.*

A tutorial box on the right side of the screen displays the following message:
```
Move around the world using the arrow keys. Press F to interact with nearby objects or people, and advance dialogue.

Press E to open your inventory, where you can see and use the items you carry in your pack, inspect your traveling companions, change your settings, and read tutorials.
```

In Abelon's inventory is an item called "Journal". Using it prompts the following message:
```
Journal: You remove the small, leather-bound book from your pack.

A: Read it

    Journal: You attempt to read it, but it will not open. It seems to be sealed shut somehow.

A: Put it away
```

On the ground nearby is a scroll. Interacting with it prompts the following message:
```
Scroll: An unfurled scroll lies among the twigs and leaves of the forest floor. It is full of strange drawings and scrawled paragraphs resembling instructions.

Scroll: The writing is faded and barely legible, and the parchment feels as though it would crumble to dust at the slightest gust of wind.

A: Pick it up

    -LABEL A-
    Scroll: You carefully roll up the scroll and place it in your pack.

    -> Gain: -Scroll-

A: Leave it

    -> Callback:

        Scroll: The scroll rests unmoving on the ground.

        A: Pick it up

            -GOTO A-
        
        A: Leave it
```

Once the scroll is in your inventory, using it prompts the following dialogue:
```
Scroll: The ancient scroll is dense with information, but none of it is intelligible to you. You aren't sure how you might use it at the moment.
```

East of Abelon's initial position, there is a silver medallion on the ground. On interacting with the medallion:
```
Medallion: On the ground is a silver medallion, strung with a thin rope and smeared with dirt. The image of a round shield over a longsword is engraved in the metal.

A: Pick it up

    -LABEL M-
    A: You brush the dirt off of the medallion and place it in your pack.

    -> Gain: -Medallion-

A: Leave it

    -> Callback:

        Medallion: The medallion glimmers on the forest floor, reflecting faint moonlight.

        A: Pick it up

            -GOTO M-
        
        A: Leave it
```

On using the medallion from your inventory:
```
Medallion: The medallion turns lazily as you hold it by the rope. You pull it over your head. The fraying rope itches the back of your neck, and the metal lump weighs on you like armor.

Medallion: Who would wear this? You put it away.
```

## Battle 1-1

*If the player moves northeast, they will come across a lone wolf, facing away from Abelon and towards Elaine's body on the ground. Moving near the wolf will cause the camera to center on it, and the wolf to turn and face Abelon. A battle initiates, with the preparation menu skipped and assists disabled.*

For the duration of the battle, the "nagivation" tutorial is replaced with a "battle" tutorial:
```
Use the arrow keys to navigate around the battle grid and between menu options. Press F to confirm a selection on the grid or in a menu. Press D to cancel a selection.

Selecting an enemy allows you to view information about the enemy.

Selecting an ally allows you to move them, choose an attack, aim the attack, use the remainder of their movement, and then confirm the entire action.

Until the action is confirmed, you can back out of any selection by pressing D. Once you confirm, the chosen ally will perform their action all at once.

Move yourself towards the enemy and aim an attack at it to damage it. Read the descriptions of your attacks and spells and pick the best option for the circumstances.
```

After the first enemy phase ends (the wolf needs two hits to kill Abelon, so the player can't have lost or won yet), a new tutorial replaces the old one:
```
Each ally may act only once during the ally phase. Once all allies have acted, the ally phase will end and all enemies on the battlefield will move and attack you. Then the ally phase begins again.

An ally or enemy dies when their health, visible underneath them, reaches zero. Keep your allies alive and defeat all enemies to win the battle.
```

## Elaine and the campsite

*After the battle is won, the player can freely move around again, and the navigation tutorial reappears.*

On interacting with Elaine's body:
```
???: It's a young girl with fair skin and fiery hair, facedown on the ground. She wears the garb of a hunter, with a bow and quiver slung on her back. She has no visible injuries but isn't moving.

A: Shake her

    ???: You shake the girl gently, but she does not stir.

A: Leave her

A: Carry her

    ???: With her equipment and bag, the girl is heavy and unwieldy to carry. You are not sure where you would take her to.

-> Callback:

    ???: The young girl is still motionless.

    A: Shake her

        ???: You shake the girl gently, but she does not stir.

    A: Leave her

    *If Abelon has found the camp*
    A: Carry her to camp

        ???: With effort, you hoist the limp girl and her belongings onto your back.

        -> Event: Screen fades to black, Elaine and Abelon teleport to camp.
        -> Flag: carried-elaine
        -> Callback:

            ???: The girl lies on her side, taking shallow breaths. She is unconscious, but alive.
```

*If the player moves further north from the battle site, they will come across a camp in a clearing. This will prompt the camera to pan around. One unoccupied and three occupied camp beds surround an unlit campfire, with packs and camp trappings scattered about. North of the camp are stone structures that look like trail markers.*

The player may interact with the campfire:
```
_: A campfire. The sticks are blackened and cold to the touch â€“ it looks to have burned out some hours ago.
```

The player may interact with the sleeping Kath:
```
???: A well-built man sleeps in the camp bed. His hand extends out of the bed and rests on a long spear, but a serene expression is just visible on his face, half-obscured by a tumble of thick black hair.
```

The player may interact with the sleeping Lester:
```
???: A pale man with blonde hair sleeps with a furrowed brow. He shifts in his camp bed, occasionally muttering something unintelligible.
```

The player may interact with the sleeping Shanti:
```
???: A dark-skinned woman, the oldest of the three by some margin. Her breathing is steady and rhythmic, and her face betrays nothing but the peace of deep sleep.
```

The player may interact with the empty camp bed:
```
_: An open camp bed. The exterior is made from leather, and the insides are filled with a soft material. It looks rather well-worn.

A: Go to sleep

    -LABEL B-

    -> Event: Screen fades to black.

    ???: What is...?

    ???: ...Need... I can't...

    -> Event: "1-2" appears in the corner of the screen.
    -> Transition: 1-2

A: Continue looking around

    -> Callback:

        _: The camp bed is still open. It doesn't appear anyone else will be using it.

        A: Go to sleep

            -GOTO B-

        A: Continue looking around

*If not carried-elaine*
A: Kill them

    -> Event: A sound effect plays and the music stops. Abelon moves to the side of the camp. As he begins drawing his sword, the screen cuts to black.

    ???: I see... Then I was overly concerned.

    ???: That is a relief.

    -> Event: "1-2" appears in the corner of the screen.
    -> Transition: 1-5-a
