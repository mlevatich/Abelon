# Abelon story attempt 2

## Motivation

Why make such a big game, when I could just make a small game? Why write a story where I have to populate two massive cities full of characters, when I'm a terrible character artist and animator, and the story that I really want to tell is about Abelon, the party, and the player?

Well, I had the sensation that good stories between characters occur over a reasonably long period of time, in which it would be unrealistic for the characters to exist in a kingdom but never arrive at any populated area over a long period of time. Moving between many locations and bouncing off different characters allows for a more complex story to unfold, and my idea of having Abelon gradually wrest control back from the player will work better as a slow burn over a long story. And for Abelon to develop so drastically as to go from a bad person to a good person is a change that can, again, only reasonably happen over a long story.

But I should consider that this is just not realistic for me, and it will hamper me from working on the project when I am trying to get a demo working while also trying to keep a massive "big picture" story in mind that constantly changes according to my own whims. Instead, perhaps I should write a short story about the party and the player that has the same introduction (Abelon is possessed by the player), a similar payoff (Abelon regains control and reconciles with the player in some small way), similar character-focus (Kath/Abelon relationship, other inter-party relationships), but with the broader setting and story being more "in the background" and hinted at, a la Hollow Knight and Dark Souls. In this short story, the party can be out on an expedition and never have to return to town at all â€“ they get caught up in a life-or-death situation unexpectedly on a mission and have to bail themselves out, and in the process learn a hidden truth about their world and save its citizens. When the danger ends and the truth is revealed, the game simply concludes.

## Gameplay implications

- I would like this game to be short but challenging, which means the difficulty curve needs to ramp up faster, and there is less room for character builds and character progression.
- Keep the number of abilities low, to be easier for me to develop AND encourage me to streamline the battle mechanics.
- Individual stat gains should be tweaked to feel more impactful, given that there will be fewer (look at HP, reaction, agility in particular). The Ignea stat may need a rework as the whole game will likely be one "expedition" with no free refills of Ignea, just restoring items scattered about.
- Optional unlockables and perks for exploring and completing battle objectives are good. Unlockables, lore (caretaker's journals), ignea refills found by exploring during roams as well. Character dialogue should be slightly different in places depending on the player's choices and the resulting impressions on the party.

## Characters

- Abelon (Battlemage):          powerful, stoic, loyal
- Kath (Paladin):               heroic, kind, jovial
- Elaine (Archer):              scared, courageous, starry-eyed
- Shanti (Scholar):             insightful, bookish, incessant
- Lester (Rogue):               clever, resentful, short-tempered
- Caretaker Mona (Healer):      tired, remorseful, curious
- King Sinclair (Not playable): severe, pragmatic, confident

## Themes

- Abelon decides not to kill the party due to the actions and choices of the players. He learns to wait, and observe, and learn before taking action, as discovering more and more about the situation leads him to disagree with the king that murdering dissenters and using brute force is the correct path. He learns that blindly following orders is a silent and insidious pain, as his possession causes him grief and his party reminds him that his obedience to the king is a similar relinquishing of agency. And he learns that there is value in companionship, camaraderie and kindness, when despite all of the party's grousing and arguing, Kath saves his life, and reveals that he cares deeply for Abelon and admires him.
