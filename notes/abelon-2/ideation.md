# Abelon Story Attempt 2

## Motivation

Why make such a big game, when I could just make a small game? Why write a story where I have to populate two massive cities full of characters, when I'm a terrible character artist and animator, and the story that I really want to tell is about Abelon, the party, and the player?

Well, I had the sensation that good stories between characters occur over a reasonably long period of time, in which it would be unrealistic for the characters to exist in a kingdom but never arrive at any populated area over a long period of time. Moving between many locations and bouncing off different characters allows for a more complex story to unfold, and my idea of having Abelon gradually wrest control back from the player will work better as a slow burn over a long story. And for Abelon to develop so drastically as to go from a bad person to a good person is a change that can, again, only reasonably happen over a long story.

But I should consider that this is just not realistic for me, and it will hamper me from working on the project when I am trying to get a demo working while also trying to keep a massive "big picture" story in mind that constantly changes according to my own whims. Instead, perhaps I should write a short story about the party and the player that has the same introduction (Abelon is possessed by the player), a similar payoff (Abelon regains control and reconciles with the player in some small way), similar character-focus (Kath/Abelon relationship, other inter-party relationships), but with the broader setting and story being more "in the background" and hinted at, a la Hollow Knight and Dark Souls. In this short story, the party can be out on an expedition and never have to return to town at all – they get caught up in a life-or-death situation unexpectedly on a mission and have to bail themselves out, and in the process learn a hidden truth about their world and save its citizens. When the danger ends and the truth is revealed, the game simply concludes.

## Gameplay implications

- I would like this game to be short but challenging, which means the difficulty curve needs to ramp up faster, and there is less room for character builds and character progression.
- Keep the number of abilities low, to be easier for me to develop AND encourage me to streamline the battle mechanics.
- Individual stat gains should be tweaked to feel more impactful, given that there will be fewer (look at HP, reaction, agility in particular). The Ignea stat may need a rework as the whole game will likely be one "expedition" with no free refills of Ignea, just restoring items scattered about.

## Characters

- Abelon (Battlemage):          powerful, stoic, loyal
- Kath (Paladin):               heroic, kind, jovial
- Elaine (Archer):              scared, courageous, starry-eyed
- Shanti (Scholar):             insightful, bookish, incessant
- Lester (Rogue):               clever, resentful, short-tempered
- Caretaker Mona (Healer):      tired, remorseful, curious
- King Sinclair (Not playable): severe, pragmatic, confident

## Themes, Ideation, and Broad Strokes

- The party sets out with a ritual scroll in hand to perform a spell to summon an ancient demonic power to assist the kingdom in its time of need. Monsters have become more and more relentless in their attacks and the last remaining city of the kingdom, its capital of Ebonach, cannot maintain its defense. The kingdom has not attempted to use the scroll because it might not work, and its use is associated with apocryphal stories of terrible calamity in ancient history. Driven into a corner, the King desires to find the ritual site in the ruins to the north to see if the spell would work, despite the dangers. A small party of elite, trusted warriors under the command of captain Abelon is sent, to avoid attracting the attention of too many monsters.

- Abelon and the king are disliked. The King is a tyrant, and Abelon is his right hand and executioner. Abelon and the King are old friends.

- Under orders from the king, Abelon had been asked to perform the ritual on his own, without the needed ritual site, and then kill everyone on this expedition using the monster attack as an excuse. He had intended to go through with it, but the player's actions will convince him otherwise. This can be fuel for intrigue – the party of disparate knights and researchers, some with no connection at all to Abelon, wonder why they in particular have been chosen for this expedition. The cover, of course, is that they are the trusted elite, but that doesn't necessarily seem true on a close inspection.

- The king is sober, cold, calculating, and slightly paranoid, but he treats Abelon as a genuine comrade. He wants to kill the party because they are too smart and have different ideas on how to solve the problem (e.g. stop mining ignea, etc). He fears they will oppose him. Kath is a public hero, so executing him is no good. The expedition is a strong excuse; they will die valiantly in battle. The king believes power will save the kingdom, and has placed his bet on the ritual scroll. He is ultimately wrong, but given the state of things, it’s not an unfathomable point of view. The king trusts Abelon and confides in him like a friend. He is not evil, but he is cunning and believes in his own authority by birthright. Abelon has absolute faith in the King, and considers the king his only friend. It is the two of them against the masses, acting in the peoples’ best interest and enduring their ire. Abelon has embraced this role fully and is not accustomed to thinking for himself. Much of this information is confirmed in a long memory scene late in the game, when Abelon meets with the king to talk and has his mission explained to him. The scene closes with the king apologizing for asking Abelon to kill Kath, as Kath is a good friend. Abelon responds frankly by saying Kath is not his friend.

- Abelon, sticking to the plan, performs the spell without anyone in the party knowing while he is on watch for the night, intending to return and slay them in their sleep. However, his newly possessed state and the player's lack of knowledge of the ritual prevents him from doing this, and prevents the plan from being disclosed until later.

- So the party sets out to trawl the ruined archives for information and find the supposed ritual site among the ruins in the northern forest. As they go, they fight monsters, talk amongst themselves about the mission, Abelon, and the state of the kingdom, and slowly discover hidden truths.

- Abelon begins to regain control of himself over time, "mastering" the demon. First he begins to talk to the player in fragmented sentences. Then he begins to perform small actions on his own during sleep, which are interrupted by the player. Finally, he interrupts the player at a climactic moment, ripping his helmet off and crying out in exasperation. There is little time to discuss until later, because there is a crisis in motion already when this happens.

- Abelon knows things that the player doesn't which can help them on their mission.

- Abelon decides not to kill the party due to the actions and choices of the players. He learns to wait, and observe, and learn before taking action, as discovering more and more about the situation leads him to disagree with the king that murdering dissenters and using brute force is the correct path. He learns that blindly following orders is a silent and insidious pain, as his possession causes him grief and his party reminds him that his obedience to the king is a similar relinquishing of agency. And he learns that there is value in companionship, camaraderie and kindness, when despite all of the party's grousing and arguing, Kath saves his life, and reveals that he cares deeply for Abelon and admires him.

- To darken the line connecting the player's actions to Abelon's change of heart, rescuing and caring for Elaine is a move made entirely by the player – Abelon would not have made such a decision. By fighting strenuously against it, the player can opt to leave Elaine to die, leading to an early bad ending in which Abelon kills the party during his first moment of control at night, saying that the demon is a power he can eventually control, and that it is a kindred spirit; they will have a long and fruitful partnership. We move forward in time to a hopeless battle in which Abelon has many powerful demonic abilities but is completely outnumbered and succumbs to the horde.

- In the good path, after recruiting Elaine, everyone eventually becomes playable, for a total of six units for the final two battles and the optional ultimate challenge, though there is a battle where the player can choose who to use, which subtly changes character endings.

- The provenance of the ritual scroll also ought to be explained at some point.

- Lester's hatred of Abelon stems from the execution of a family member on the king's orders. Lester became a knight to surpass Abelon and take his place as captain.

- Kath’s dad Stefan is the old third knight captain. Friend of Abelon’s. Not a great dude, kinda like Abelon. Prioritized his home of Lefally over Kath, after helping him escape the giant monster, Stefan went back into the blaze. Kath resolved to never do that, so he is kind. Kath hates that Abelon reminds him of his dad, but can't help but admire the old knight.

- At some point in Part 1, the party celebrates the turn of the new year over a campfire.

- Optional unlockables and perks for exploring and completing battle objectives are good. A branching story, beyond the simple good/bad I have here, is probably not going to make sense. I won't rule out an optional battle, but it would need to be done carefully. Optional lore details should mostly be left to the optional final battle, but lore scattered around and optional talk conversations can add color to the world and its history. Character dialogue should be slightly different in places depending on the player's choices and the resulting impressions on the party.

- The world has an ancient history. This can be learned from finding journals of the Caretaker deep in the archives, and speaking with the Caretaker.

- After beating 2-6, the player can choose whether or not to continue to the ultimate battle or end the game with the expedition a success. Mona strenuously advises against continuing, almost but not quite to the point of fourth wall breaking (i.e. don't continue unless you are very, very skilled). Ending the game here causes a timeskip forward into a scene where an older Abelon speaks to the suddenly stirring demon as an old friend. Learning the truths in battle 13 and the ending the game results in the same timeskip and cutscene, but with some details changed to reflect a more "complete" golden path ending. Depending on the party's impressions of Abelon, their fates and the way he relays them in this scene may also be slightly different.
