## Chronological story

With the Despair looming over the city, the King has decided to take a drastic course of action. A search party has returned from the ruins of Lefellen with an ancient ritual scroll, containing preparatory steps and incantations necessary to summon and command what is supposedly an astonishingly powerful "Demon of Old". The King sends both Abelon and Kath, another accomplished knight Lester, and Ebonach's premier Ignaeic scholar Shanti on an expedition north to the ritual site. Abelon leads the group, which is ostensibly small in an attempt to avoid detection and not leave the city defenseless.

Before the events of the game Abelon gets told to do the ritual early and kill everyone with the demon. TODO

The four make their way into the forest towards the ruins of Lefellen, with the hopes of humanity pinned on their success. They make it through much of the forest without incident, and camp for the night in some ruins on the outskirts of Lefellen. Abelon offers to take the second watch. Upon being woken up for the second watch, Abelon absconds to a nearby clearing to perform the summoning ritual out of sight, feeling the party far enough from Ebonach to hide evidence of foul play, and close enough to Lefellen for the ritual to work.

The game begins alone, at night, in a forested clearing. Abelon was on watch and stepped away to perform a ritual. Of course, the player doesn't know that. The player can only wander through the forest at night. They immediately find a wolf and dispatch it in the tutorial battle before coming across the campfire with sleeping comrades in front of the entrance to some sort of ruins. The player may also run across an unconscious Elaine, but interacting with her doesn't prompt you to do anything (maybe shake her). You can examine things around camp, but otherwise can only go to bed. The entire party is gone when you wake up. This is because ... But the player isn't aware of that.
