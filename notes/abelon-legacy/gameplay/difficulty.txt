On Normal difficulty, battles are designed to be beatable with fair ignea usage
and inefficient (but not brainless) strategy. Quest rewards and exploration are
not necessary.

On Adept difficulty, battles are beatable with careful strategy and significant
resource usage. Rewards from quests and explorations introduce a buffer that
allows players to make mistakes. Beating the game on Adept while ignoring every
single side objective is possible, but should require nearly flawless strategy.

On Master difficulty, battles are beatable with excellent strategy and
significant resource usage, requiring the player to explore thoroughly and pay
attention to quest lines in order to have enough resources to win all of the
battles.

Difficulty can be lowered but not raised.
