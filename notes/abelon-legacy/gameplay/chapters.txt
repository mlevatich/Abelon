The game is divided into chapters. Chapters fall into two rough categories:
questing chapters and expedition chapters.

Expedition chapters occur when the party has a destination and is trying to
get there - there are very limited opportunities to replenish resources, few
people to talk to, few quests to go on, few to no fail states, and the story is
sustained by intra-party interactions. The chapter will have an open layout that
encourages exploration, and many battles to encounter.

Questing chapters occur when the party is at a destination and figuring out
what to do there or what the situation is. The party is split up during questing
chapters, so Abelon flies solo and may meet the party members around the area.
Exploration is still encouraged, but the total map area is smaller than in an
expedition chapter. It is, however, more densely populated with people and
quest lines! The story is advanced most in these places, through mysteries to
investigate, interweaving quest lines, high-drama cinematics, and new
characters. Many of the rewards to be gained in questing chapters serve as good
preparation for an upcoming expedition chapter. Questing chapters have some
battles, but far fewer than an expedition chapter.

Currently, the game is planned to be 7 chapters long. Chapters 1, 3, 5, and 6
are expedition chapters (there is a small quest hub between 5 and 6), while
chapters 2 and 4 are questing chapters. Chapter 7 is a hybrid.
