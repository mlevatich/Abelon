CHAPTER 7: The Cardinal and the Caretaker
*****************************************

NOTES
*****

Gaheris knows the secrets came from the past, so he goes to the ash archives by Lefellen. Big drain on kingdom
resources, but the king allows it (why?), upsetting everyone. In chapter 6, return home from ash after meeting up
with Gaheris, to find that the place is under attack. He found out the world is waking,  and we need to put it to
sleep by stopping the Messenger. He says it was defeated by the power of a demon inhabiting a great knight
but corrupting him, saving the world but turning the knight towards darkness. But the book of incantations for
summoning the demon was missing from the archives (because Abelon retrieved it before the story began).

To progress from this point, the player must retrieve the book of incantations from the summoning site.
If you've been good to Abelon, he'll let you read his diary hidden under the books.
Otherwise, he'll do it himself and leave the diary behind. If you've been good,
he'll also tell Gaheris that the demon was actually kind. Learning we have the demon on our side convinces
Gaheris we have a chance, but we need to confront the King to find out why he wanted the Caretaker and
Cardinals dead, but allowed Gaheris to investigate the archives.

Abelon makes a decision for you towards the end in a dramatic moment.

The late choices are about Kath, Gaheris, the King, and the Watchers, and Jericho.

Jericho is distraught over having led a doomed expedition, and is filled with hatred towards the messenger. He is not
ok with caring for it.

Abelon takes more control by this point in the story.

Abelon has basically taken control entirely by this point. If you make a decision, it is because he trusts you
and lets you.

Either put the messenger to sleep or kill it, outside the west gate at the Sonder.

You will have to fight Jericho here, who is determined to kill the messenger, unable to move past what it did to his men.
A tragic character to the end.

A cool "power trip" idea for the final boss is when you're in dire straits, you suddenly get infinite
ignea and can go nuts.

Another fun power trip idea is for every character to have access to a "blowout"
ability that has a massive effect but prevents them from using ignea for the
rest of the game. This may be a bit hard to execute. But if the eventual
trajectory of the plot is for no one to use ignea anymore, it could be
thematically resonant.

Abelon has some choice over who the next cardinal and caretaker will be. The options depend on impressions as well.
