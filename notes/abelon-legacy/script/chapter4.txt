CHAPTER 4: Mining Hope
**********************

NOTES
*****

The previous chapter (3) is mostly character driven, although you do learn some
new plot details, indirectly. This chapter should be very plot-driven. On the
immediate level, the people of Mistram are on the verge of finding new ways to
fight the despair, though they need to overcome infighting. You get hints as to
the bigger picture of Eruta as well, and why the despair is happening, with the
crumbling cavern incident, among other things. And you start to get an idea of
why the King sent you to Mistram. After all, it's chapter 4 now - things ought
to start moving very quickly (as though the player is approaching a conclusion,
to make the events of the end of the chapter more unexpected and drastic).

I have a better idea for the final battle of this chapter and the following
events.

The messenger shows
up suddenly, trampling everything and moving towards Mistram. You defend the
East gates, but it becomes obvious the thing cannot be stopped. You distract it
and lead it slightly to the North, away from the village, but you don't know
how to get away from it or stop it from attacking Mistram if it loses interest
in you. One of Uther or Opal comes with you, while the other stays to organize
an evacuation. A caravan will lead all Mistram to Ebonach. Another earthquake
strikes, and based on that and the events of the chapter (mining tunnel
collapse), someone gets the idea to trap the messenger in a manually triggered
landslide in the icy canyon to the north. This is obviously near-suicidal, but
the messenger is a force of nature, and no one has any better ideas. The landslide
comes down and we fade to black. The chapter ends.

At some point, Abelon begs to have some control. You can agree, or tell him his
choices are wrong. The latter ultimately turns him against you, while the former
opens him up to be influenced by your good or bad deeds.

Final battle is an encounter with the Messenger where you defend against it.

Defending Mistram interrupts the rest area. Corrupted miners turn on you.
What to do? Can they be saved?

Need Uther and Opal to win the final battle of Chapter 2.

The choices in chapter 2 are all about reconciling Uther and the miners with
Opal and the guard.

Abelon likes you if you side with the guard, and doesn't like if you side with
the miners. If you unify them, he comes to understand a little more.

At some point, you have the option of having Ebonach soldiers cross the Sonder
for some reason, led by Jericho. It is hinted that the expedition will be
extremely dangerous and is a bad idea. Whoever you choose to send (if you
have a choice) will die to the Messenger.

Other citizens in Mistram:
The miners
The guard
The children and caretakers at the day care (children are raised communally â€“
all other hands on deck to mine and, sometimes, be on the guard)
