The people of Eruta are in the twilight of their despair. In the world of Eruta,
monsters have always existed and always been a threat to humans, but they have
grown stronger and more aggressive in the last 30 years, and even more
dangerous in the last 5, to the point where the kingdom is now utterly strapped
for resources dealing with them. A village to the west mines Ignea from the
mountains, an essential resource for keeping the kingdom safe, because it powers
magical spells and abilities. Shipments of Ignea flow to the capital, and
shipments of food flow to the mining village. A division of elite knights, led
by knight captain Opal, guards the village. Opal has been driving them hard
lately, out of a need for more Ignea, and personally overseeing the shipments
to the kingdom to defend the supply caravans crossing the Sonder. Ignea has
only recently become more important than food, and the ocean's bounties and
the nearby farmland were always important for keeping the citizens fed, which is
why the castle is on the east coast, rather than close to the mines. Abelon and
Kath, the two other knight captains, defend the Capital. A settlement to the
north already fell, razed by dragons 20 years ago, and the people live in fear
of dragons, the most dangerous monsters of all. There are other faraway kingdoms
in this world, but the monsters have made contact too perilous, and no one
knows what's happening to those places anymore.
