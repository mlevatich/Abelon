There are fail states representing alternate endings. You must compromise between opposing sides to get everyone
and put the world back to sleep. Power of friendship!

How to design a chapter:

Come up with a setting and a set of characters.

Fill in the broad strokes of who the characters are, what their backstories are, and their worldview and goals.
Make sure there plenty of opportunities for them to come into conflict with each other.

Come up with a list of quests, big and small, that involve all of the characters.

ALL quests should:
-tie together different characters or factions to present an interesting conflict or mystery
-have dialogue options, and require at least a modicum of deductive intelligence from the player
-give side characters space to breath and grow so the player can get attached
-Reveal new things about the characters
-Reveal new things about the world, i.e. matters having to do with religion, culture, hierarchy, geography, magic, etc.
-Disclose an otherwise small hidden nugget of relevant story information
-Provide some reward, which might be: a big piece of critical info, money, items, a party member, a new ability
-should have a tangible if small impact on the global chapter state

MOST quests should:
-require using items and interacting with the environment
-have at least one cinematic
-be possible to fail, leading to no reward
-be relevant or re-introduced later in the story in some quest or non-quest form
-interact with at least one other immediate quest in some way (you can only complete one, or you have to progress
 through both at the same time, or you need the reward from one in another, or one is impossible to guess through
 without info from the other, etc)

SOME quests should:
-dramatically change the global state of the chapter
-unlock a new area and new characters within the chapter
-cause a fail state if messed up
-be mandatory
-be optional but valuable
-be optional and mostly useless
-unlock new quests
-bar the player from completing a different quest
-require a battle
-require completing a previous (optional) quest to complete but not start
-stretch across more than one chapter before reaching any resolution

Emphasize early – gather information and make decisions, even subtle decisions can have big impacts but there are
always clues.

The order in which you discuss with people matters, and you can discern a good ordering if you’re paying attention.

If you do everything right and pay attention, you should be able to get the good ending on the first try.

I can bake some real mysteries into this. Like following the journey of a custom made sword after it's stolen by
thieves, or learning people's names. One mystery is Abelon's past – what did he do? This is found out, towards the
end of Chapter 1.

Every character is named, unique, important. You never know who will matter.

Focus on making information gathering subtle, and acting on that information fair but challenging.

Exploration is an important hook – using items to interact with and change the environment, progressing quests or
unlocking new areas of the map. Allow the player to discover quite a bit WITHOUT talking. Additionally, more
"traditional" puzzles where appropriate.

Line between rest areas and expeditions needs to blur a bit so that there can be important IN BATTLE decisions
affecting the story (e.g. who to save).

Player should never be able to continue a doomed playthrough for long, except maybe on one "bad route" where you
kill the Messenger. Various things towards the end can put you on this track irrevocably.
