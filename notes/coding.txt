What to do next, organized into sections and issues! (please commit each
paragraph separately for your own sanity)

CHAPTER 1 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

-Finish script 1-2 for abelon-2
-Write script 1-3 for abelon-2
-Write Part 1 of narrative.md for abelon-2

-In battle, HUD should show how much damage/healing you are about to do and what
statuses you will apply to each enemy/ally, when an attack is selected.

assisted tiles

    #?: Improve AI algorithm
    improve AI algorithm - use other plans! In particular, enemies shouldn't
    interfere with each other. If one enemy has only a single path to attack their
    target, the acting enemy shouldn't get in the way of that path unless it
    needs to in order to attack its own target. To minimize interference in general,
    the strongest enemies should take their turns first, and the enemies who start
    farther away from the allies should also be prioritized.

#72:
    #66

#68:
    Last pass over script for consistency
    #?: Animation sound effects
    #9: Lighting engine. Flickering, smoothing, obstacle detection (sprite
        parameter deciding whether it blocks light may be needed. e.g. abelon blocks
        light but a log doesn't), proper color computation. Look up lua/love shaders.
        Alternate, darken with patterns of black pixels over tiles?
    #?: "splash" animations
    Portraits

#73:
    Make executable

#74:
    Pre-alpha closed release





SECTION: GAME ENTRY-EXIT PROCEDURES

#16:

Title screen v0 (continue (if save file detected), new game ->
choose difficulty). Title screen should have controls in one corner

Implement game start scene, implement ??? for sprites whose names are not known
to the player. Learning a name is a scene event.

Chapter 1 start card

#59:

Chapter end trigger. Displays a bridge scene (??? talks again), and chapter 2
start card (Teaser). Kicks you back to the title screen

#48:

Tutorial information should appear on the right side of the screen, in the
middle. Tutorial paragraphs are given in the script. They are also accessible
from the settings menu in a "tutorial" menu.

Support GOTOs in scenes for sane script-writing.

Use a better format than a text file for writing a branching story?





SECTION: ANIMATION WORK

#51:

Support animation on combat entry (bridges idle -> combat), and on for 
combat exit (this can just be the combat entry animation played in reverse).
For hostile entities, their combat entry and exit are just their idle
animations, because their idle animation is their combat animation.

Abelon-combat-entry-exit
Abelon-combat-idle
Abelon-combat-run (try same feet as walk but bump animation speed?)

Kath-combat-entry-exit
Kath-combat-idle
Kath-combat-run

Two mostly identical wolf sprites
Wolf-idle (this doubles as Wolf-combat-idle)
Wolf-walk (this doubles as Wolf-combat-run)

#52:

Every skill has an associated single-fire animation, with render position
determined by the cursor location of the cast. This has nothing to do with the
sprite casting the skill. For some skills, the animation should play at every
affected tile, for others, the animation should play centered on the cursor and
affected by direction. This should be provided as an option.

Skill animations for all basic skills.

#53:

Each sprite that battles has five single-fire animations: one for weapon
skills, one for spells, one for assists, one for being injured, and one for 
dying. Hostile entities have no assist animation, and in some cases, no spell 
animation (e.g. for wolves).

Abelon-weapon
Abelon-spell
Abelon-assist
Abelon-hurt
Abelon-death

Kath-weapon
Kath-spell
Kath-assist
Kath-hurt
Kath-death

Wolf-weapon
Wolf-hurt
Wolf-death

#?:

When sprites take damage, a damage splash should be rendered. When they heal,
a heal splash should be rendered. This should happen as the damage is dealt.
The idea of a "splash" animation could be re-used for skill animations.

When sprites gain exp, render exp splash. This should happen on a delay, so
the exp splash renders after the relevant action has just finished playing out.





SECTION: SFX WORK

#4:

SFX for:
menu select (not too different from current)
Scene text sound effects
start game (from title screen)

#56:

SFX for:
battle cursor move
Mute ally turn start, enemy turn start, victory, defeat menus
battle select ally/enemy, target for move/attack/assist, confirm end action
battle enemy turn start
battle ally turn start
level up
use weapon skill
use spell
use assist
skills (can re-use liberally)
earthquake

#?:

Explore "animation sound effects": looping sound effects associated with an
animation and based on proximity to the sprite, like a crackling torch, or
a person's footsteps. Not an easy task!!





SECTION: MUSIC TRACKS

#63:

Fade is quieter than it should be. Make sure tracks don't change volume!

For title screen music, use the voice memo on my phone: Time Slows. Tentative
track name: The Lonely Knight. Experiment with slow crescendos! And quiet bass.

#64:

Defeat theme: Despair - Short theme that plays during the battle loss scene.

#65:

Enemy approaches theme - for rising action before a fight! This should play for
most of the forest.

#66:

Second battle theme - for the last encounter. This just got much more serious.

#67:

Better forest theme - more tense investigation, less funeral march
