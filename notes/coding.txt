What to do next, organized into sections and issues! (please commit each
paragraph separately for your own sanity)

SECTION: GAME ENTRY-EXIT PROCEDURES

#16:

Title screen v0 (continue (if save file detected), new game ->
choose difficulty). Title screen should have controls in one corner

Implement game start scene, implement ??? for sprites whose names are not known
to the player. Learning a name is a scene event.

#48:

Implement re-written script

Tutorial information should appear on the right side of the screen, in the
middle. Tutorial paragraphs are given in the script. They are also accessible
from the settings menu in a "tutorial" menu.

One more tutorial than whats in the script happens in the Elaine section, to
tell you about your items, using them, and presenting them.

#59:

Chapter end trigger. Displays a chapter 1 endcard, bridge scene, and chapter 2
start card (Teaser). Kicks you back to the title screen





SECTION: MAP WORK

#57:

fullpath: smaller stones
fullpath: more moss, dirt specks
4 path sides, 8 path corners
conform ground tiles around path
move sprites out of the way of path

Updated, populated maps for:
north forest
east forest
south forest

Slightly different tilesets for the four maps (e.g. north map has a dusting of
ash on the tiles)
Fill in black lines to avoid quad bleeding

#9:

Expand lighting engine. Flickering, smoothing, obstacle detection (sprite
parameter deciding whether it blocks light may be needed. e.g. abelon blocks
light but a log doesn't), proper color computation (see note on phone). Look up
lua/love shaders





SECTION: ANIMATION WORK

#52:

Every skill has an associated single-fire animation, with render position
determined by the cursor location of the cast. This has nothing to do with the
sprite casting the skill. For some skills, the animation should play at every
affected tile, for others, the animation should play centered on the cursor and
affected by direction. This should be provided as an option.

Insert appropriate hooks for skill animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Skill animations for all basic skills.

When sprites take damage, a damage splash should be rendered. When they heal,
a heal splash should be rendered. This should happen as the damage is dealt.
The idea of a "splash" animation could be re-used for skill animations.

When sprites gain exp, render exp splash. This should happen on a delay, so
the exp splash renders after the relevant action has just finished playing out.

#51:

Abelon-combat
Kath-combat
Elaine-combat

Abelon-combat-run
Kath-combat-run
Elaine-combat-run

Two mostly identical wolf sprites.

Wolf-combat (this doubles as Wolf-idle)
Wolf-walk (this doubles as Wolf-combat-run)

#53:

Each sprite that battles has seven single-fire animations: one for weapon
skills, one for spells, one for assists, one for being injured, one for dying,
one for combat entry (bridges idle -> combat), and one for combat exit (this
can just be the combat entry animation played in reverse). For hostile entities,
their combat entry and exit are just their idle animations, because their idle
animation is their combat animation. Hostile entities also have no assist
animation, and in some cases, no spell animation (e.g. for wolves)

Insert appropriate hooks for combat animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Abelon-combat-entry-exit
Abelon-weapon
Abelon-spell
Abelon-assist
Abelon-hurt
Abelon-death

Kath-combat-entry-exit
Kath-weapon
Kath-spell
Kath-assist
Kath-hurt
Kath-death

Elaine-combat-entry-exit
Elaine-weapon
Elaine-spell
Elaine-assist
Elaine-hurt
Elaine-death

Wolf-weapon
Wolf-hurt
Wolf-death





SECTION: SFX WORK

#4:

SFX for:
menu select (not too different from current)
Scene text sound effects
start game (from title screen)

#56:

SFX for:
use weapon skill
use spell
use assist
battle cursor move
battle select ally/enemy
battle select target for move/attack/assist
battle confirm end action
battle enemy turn start
battle ally turn start
level up
all skills

Mute ally turn start, enemy turn start, victory, defeat menus

#?:

Explore "animation sound effects": looping sound effects associated with an
animation and based on proximity to the sprite, like a crackling torch, or
a person's footsteps. Not an easy task!!





SECTION: MUSIC TRACKS

Fade is quieter than it should be. Make sure tracks don't change volume!
There are still things to improve about the first fight theme right now.

#63:

For title screen music, use the voice memo on my phone: Time Slows. Tentative
track name: The Lonely Knight. Experiment with slow crescendos!

#64:

Defeat theme: Despair - Short theme that plays during the battle loss scene.

#65:

Enemy approaches theme - for rising action before a fight! This should play for
most of the forest.

#66:

Second battle theme - for the three non-boss encounters (or the boss encounter
if it's more epic than the first theme)

#67:

Better forest theme - more tense investigation, less funeral march





SECTION: CHAPTER 1 IMPLEMENTATION

#68:

Finish script

#69:

Writing:
Implement Elaine's skills
Write Elaine scene into script

Art:
Draw Elaine icons
Draw Elaine sprite
Draw Elaine portrait

Animations:
Fix the stupid wolf animation flickering
Kath-idle, Elaine-idle, Elaine-walk, Elaine-Downed, Elaine-Getup

Finish #57, #48

Implement Elaine battle. Race a wolf to get to her! Not only is it a race, the
wolf only targets her. Kath can get in the way, but Abelon is further behind,
and you need to kill it before it gets to Elaine. Reinforcements show
up as well, and you must defend Elaine. Elaine is an ally unit for the purposes
of the battle, but starts at 1hp and has status debuffs that make her unable to
move, and the only skill she knows is Observe. Observe grants her a small amount
of Exp, which causes her to level up to level 2, so she can learn her first
attacking skill after the battle, but she should not gain any other experience
during the fight.

Once she's saved and the battle is over, find her the right medicine to heal
her, and she'll join the party!

Update exp table to account for bonus exp, and to make Elaine's and Abelon's
growth curves fair. Either Abelon or Kath, but probably not both, should level
up in the second battle. Elaine should level up once each battle if you use her.
Potentially she could get from 2 to 4 in her first real battle.

Test out Elaine's skills in a mock battle

#70:

implement Lester scenario (objective is rout, optionally have Lester escape)

improve AI algorithm - use other plans! In particular, enemies shouldn't
interfere with each other. If one enemy has only a single path to attack their
target, the acting enemy shouldn't get in the way of that path unless it
needs to in order to attack its own target. To minimize interference in general,
the strongest enemies should take their turns first, and the enemies who start
farther away from the allies should also be prioritized.

#71:

implement Shanti/Ceryl scenario

#72:

Implement Ceryl death scenario (objective is survive)

Implement chapter conclusion scenario

#73:

Make executable

#74:

Pre-alpha closed release
