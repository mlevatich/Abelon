What to do next, organized into sections and issues! (please commit each
paragraph separately for your own sanity)

Right now: look at #69 below

SECTION: GAME ENTRY-EXIT PROCEDURES

#16:

Title screen v0 (continue (if save file detected), new game ->
choose difficulty). Title screen should have controls in one corner

Implement game start scene, implement ??? for sprites whose names are not known
to the player. Learning a name is a scene event.

#48:

Tutorial information should appear on the right side of the screen, in the
middle. Tutorial paragraphs are given in the script. They are also accessible
from the settings menu in a "tutorial" menu.

#?:

Support GOTOs in scenes for sane script-writing.

Use a better format than a text file for writing a branching story?

#59:

Chapter end trigger. Displays a chapter 1 endcard, bridge scene, and chapter 2
start card (Teaser). Kicks you back to the title screen





SECTION: MAP WORK

#57:

Updated, populated maps for:
north forest
east forest
south forest

Slightly different tilesets for the four maps (e.g. north map has a dusting of
ash on the tiles)
Fill in black lines to avoid quad bleeding

#9:

Expand lighting engine. Flickering, smoothing, obstacle detection (sprite
parameter deciding whether it blocks light may be needed. e.g. abelon blocks
light but a log doesn't), proper color computation. Look up lua/love shaders

Alternate, darken with patterns of black pixels over tiles?





SECTION: ANIMATION WORK

#52:

Every skill has an associated single-fire animation, with render position
determined by the cursor location of the cast. This has nothing to do with the
sprite casting the skill. For some skills, the animation should play at every
affected tile, for others, the animation should play centered on the cursor and
affected by direction. This should be provided as an option.

Insert appropriate hooks for skill animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Skill animations for all basic skills.

When sprites take damage, a damage splash should be rendered. When they heal,
a heal splash should be rendered. This should happen as the damage is dealt.
The idea of a "splash" animation could be re-used for skill animations.

When sprites gain exp, render exp splash. This should happen on a delay, so
the exp splash renders after the relevant action has just finished playing out.

#51:

Abelon-combat
Kath-combat
Elaine-combat

Abelon-combat-run
Kath-combat-run
Elaine-combat-run

Two mostly identical wolf sprites.

Wolf-combat (this doubles as Wolf-idle)
Wolf-walk (this doubles as Wolf-combat-run)

#53:

Each sprite that battles has seven single-fire animations: one for weapon
skills, one for spells, one for assists, one for being injured, one for dying,
one for combat entry (bridges idle -> combat), and one for combat exit (this
can just be the combat entry animation played in reverse). For hostile entities,
their combat entry and exit are just their idle animations, because their idle
animation is their combat animation. Hostile entities also have no assist
animation, and in some cases, no spell animation (e.g. for wolves)

Insert appropriate hooks for combat animations to play at the right points in
battle (fill in with a universal default).

Abelon-combat-entry-exit
Abelon-weapon
Abelon-spell
Abelon-assist
Abelon-hurt
Abelon-death

Kath-combat-entry-exit
Kath-weapon
Kath-spell
Kath-assist
Kath-hurt
Kath-death

Elaine-combat-entry-exit
Elaine-weapon
Elaine-spell
Elaine-assist
Elaine-hurt
Elaine-death

Wolf-weapon
Wolf-hurt
Wolf-death





SECTION: SFX WORK

#4:

SFX for:
menu select (not too different from current)
Scene text sound effects
start game (from title screen)

#56:

SFX for:
use weapon skill
use spell
use assist
battle cursor move
battle select ally/enemy
battle select target for move/attack/assist
battle confirm end action
battle enemy turn start
battle ally turn start
level up
all skills

Mute ally turn start, enemy turn start, victory, defeat menus

#?:

Explore "animation sound effects": looping sound effects associated with an
animation and based on proximity to the sprite, like a crackling torch, or
a person's footsteps. Not an easy task!!





SECTION: MUSIC TRACKS

Fade is quieter than it should be. Make sure tracks don't change volume!
There are still things to improve about the first fight theme right now.

#63:

For title screen music, use the voice memo on my phone: Time Slows. Tentative
track name: The Lonely Knight. Experiment with slow crescendos! And quiet bass.

#64:

Defeat theme: Despair - Short theme that plays during the battle loss scene.

#65:

Enemy approaches theme - for rising action before a fight! This should play for
most of the forest.

#66:

Second battle theme - for the last encounter. This just got much more serious.

#67:

Better forest theme - more tense investigation, less funeral march





SECTION: CHAPTER 1 IMPLEMENTATION

#69:

Finish #57

Do GAME-ENTRY-EXIT section

#63

In battle, HUD should show how much damage/healing you are about to do and what
statuses you will apply to each enemy, when an attack is selected.

Kath-idle
Kath-heal
Screen shake

Implement rewritten beginning of script

Tweak Elaine portrait and sprite
Elaine-idle, Elaine-walk, Elaine-Downed, Elaine-Getup

Implement Elaine script.

Implement Elaine battle. Defend her from wolves! Keep them away. Reinforcements
arrive twice, once from next to Elaine (with a warning from her), and once from
further away. The battle ends automatically after a certain number of turns and
all wolves flee. Elaine is an ally unit for the purposes of the battle, but
starts at 1hp and has status debuffs that make her unable to move, and the only
skill she knows is Observe. Observe grants her a small amount of Exp, which
causes her to level up to level 2, so she can learn her first attacking skill
after the battle, but she cannot gain any other experience during the fight.

Update exp table to account for bonus exp, and to make Elaine's and Abelon's
growth curves fair. Either Abelon or Kath, but probably not both, should level
up in the second battle. Elaine should level up once each battle if you use her.
Potentially she could get from 2 to 4 in her first real battle.

Test out Elaine's skills in a mock battle

#70:

implement Lester scenario (version with and version without Elaine)

improve AI algorithm - use other plans! In particular, enemies shouldn't
interfere with each other. If one enemy has only a single path to attack their
target, the acting enemy shouldn't get in the way of that path unless it
needs to in order to attack its own target. To minimize interference in general,
the strongest enemies should take their turns first, and the enemies who start
farther away from the allies should also be prioritized.

#71:

implement Shanti scenario (four versions: saved lester and elaine quickly so
Shanti is saveable, Saved Elaine out of battle so Shanti dies, sent lester to 
Elaine and he dies, or skipped Elaine)

#72:

Implement visiting Elaine's corpse scenario

Implement bridge battle scenario (four versions: Lester dead, Shanti dead,
Elaine dead, all alive) (objective is survive)

Implement chapter conclusion scenario

#68:

Last pass over script for consistency

#73:

Make executable

#74:

Pre-alpha closed release
